**ARC-P GCC** provides agencies and government contractors physical or virtual machines in a shared government only cloud stack. ARC-P is a KVM based cloud system that assures interoperability and support for multiple hypervisor images. Agency virtualized images can be imported and exported from the ARC-P environment at agency request. ARC-P can support large numbers of agency virtual machines with the ability to scale services up and down according to agency customers’ varying requirements. ARC-P IaaS offers additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk image library, raw (block) and file-based storage, customer virtual network (CVN) separation at layer 2, firewalls, load balancers, public facing IP addresses, and software bundles. ARC-P IaaS supplies elastic compute resources on-demand from ARC-P compute pools installed in our CONUS only data centers. For cloud environment connectivity, agencies can use available ARC-P VPN solutions over the Internet or dedicated carrier clouds and circuits.
**ARC-P GPC** offers the same features as ARC-P GCC with additional logical and physical separation for private cloud environments that require a dedicated hardware stack.
**ARC-P SDC** (Secure Data Center) service provides agencies and government contractors secure IT system colocation services to assist with federal data center consolidation mandates along with their cloud first requirements.

Customers can engage resources in an a la carte, and “pay for performance” model that allows them to know exactly what to expect – It’s the technology you need, when you need it.
All infrastructure resources are managed and monitored through the KPS tool “Zeus”, which is included within the boundaries of the CloudSeed system, and gives customers the ability to view and manage cloud resources across the full range of possible KPS cloud deployments – Public, Federal Community, and Private - as well as across multiple CSPs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and on-premise virtualization technologies (ESXi, KVM, etc.). By providing customers this single pane of glass to both view and manage all of their infrastructure solutions, Zeus allows for true “hybrid” cloud solutions that can combine pre-existing customer solutions with new cloud-based solutions. Zeus gives customers a truly ""holistic"" view into their infrastructure, and allows them to move workloads across solutions as-needed to address specific business requirements.
The technical architecture that makes up CloudSeed is also available via the KPS Public Cloud for both Federal and Commercial customers, as well as in private cloud deployments on a customer's premises or in KPS' FedRAMP compliant data center. This architecture providers cheap, efficient, and reliable clouds by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and automatically and instantly recognizing every piece of hardware that is plugged into the system as simply Compute, Storage, or Network resources. In other words, KPS customers are able to use their pre-existing equipment as the basis for their own private cloud deployment simply by connecting it to the system via ethernet or fiber cable. Through this technology, customers are able to instantiate an entire cloud from scratch in under 20 minutes while re-using many of the same technical controls implemented in Knight Point's Federal Cloud, giving them previously unparalleled flexibility in their cloud deployments.",2018-05-23T04:00:00.000Z,Ryan Lewis,info@knightpoint.com,2018-05-16T04:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/Agency_logos/Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security.png,United States Coast Guard,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GSS is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each Application deployed on the FPC. There are two main types of customers who use the FPC: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multitenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal agencies deploying dedicated applications just for their agency (not multitenant). For both types of customer, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or Azure PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets. Network security group access controls ensure that each customer’s subnet is completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer’s subnet. For agency customers, PH assists the Agency in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides monthly application-level POA&M and continuous monitoring artifacts.

Zscaler,Zscaler Private Access – Government (Zero Trust Networking – VPN Replacement),Agency,Compliant,FR1719759604,SaaS,Government Community Cloud,Moderate,2018-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,Federal Communications Commission,Federal Communications Commission,https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Zscaler%20Logo.png,"Schellman & Company, LLC",www.zscaler.com,"**ZSCALER PRIVATE ACCESS**
**The first major breakthrough in secure remote access since the VPN**
Zscaler is a leader in securing Internet traffic for enterprises around the globe, with a cloud-based security platform designed to protect enterprise Internet traffic with Secure Web Gateway, Cloud Application Visibility and Control, Cloud Sandboxing, Data Loss Prevention, and more. Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets.
Zscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience.
With Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service.
Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.
**Improve your security posture even as you provide seamless access**
The reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.
**Connect by application, not by IP address**
VPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
Eliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment
As part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your “client sprawl” by delivering a
single app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more.
Take your applications from “on-net” to “dark- net,” at the same time YOU get complete visibility. Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unroutable to anyone. But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never before been possible. Once you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are actually running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected! And once you know what applications are running, you can easily create granular access rules for them.
App Discovery makes deployment easy.",2018-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,Stephen Kovac,fedramp@zscaler.com,2017-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGENCYAMAZONEW,,,,,,https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/Agency_logos/US-FCC-Seal.png,,,,,,F1603047866,,,,,,,2019-08-30T04:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The City of LA, State of New York, FEMA, Department of Homeland Security and many other government agencies rely on the Acquia platform to build websites and digital experiences that meet the needs of their citizens, internal users and IT teams while moving their missions forward.
These agencies know that a citizen-centric government requires more than simply taking the existing physical structure and making it digital. Today the term “digital” has taken on a new meaning. In the private sector, consumers can shop, pay bills, and even conduct banking online, and now they’re expecting to conduct government business online in the same way. The most forward-thinking government IT managers are finding ways to meet expectations set by the private sector, and then going above and beyond to serve citizens.

Vaulting away shared account passwords, application passwords, and secrets is just one of the best practices to secure privileged access. Managing the vaulted credentials, leveraging secure administrative access via a distributed local jump box, establishing VPN-less privileged session to remotely access targeted infrastructure, and implementing multi-factor authentication are at the root of reducing threats, intentional or not. Centrify PAS allows for all the above, as well as enables agencies to authenticate internal and outsourced IT users through Active Directory, LDAP, or other cloud identity stores. Agencies can use one or any combination of these identity stores or grant granular, federated privileged access to resources for partners and third-party vendors. Ultimately, Centrify PAS grants access from a Web UI or mobile app and covers an agency’s entire attack surface, both on-premises and in the cloud. Centrify PAS minimizes the attack surface, improves audit and compliance visibility, and reduces risk, complexity, and costs. Centrify PAS seamlessly integrates with Centrify’s other solutions, namely the Centrify Authentication Service (which helps verify who requests privileged access by leveraging enterprise directory identities rather than local accounts) and Centrify Privilege Elevation Service (which enables host-based enforcement of just enough, just-in-time privileged access best practices).",2019-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,Centrify FedRAMP Team,fedramp@centrify.com,2017-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGENCYAMAZONEW,,,,,,https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/Agency_logos/DFC%20Logo.jpg,,,,,,F1603087869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its web interface offers fully secure email archiving with robust search and discovery, supervision, and enforcement features. The solution securely stores electronic messages for a specified retention period, while keeping the messages fully searchable and retrievable in real-time or with a batch process. This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user’s email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.
The Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with *Proofpoint’s DoubleBlind™ Encryption* technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.
*Proofpoint’s DoubleBlind™ Encryption* technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment.

By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.
**The Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security**
The data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations.
However, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today’s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances — and their associated costs — are out of control. Furthermore, it’s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.
**Zscaler Internet Access**
Zscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp — all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect — a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office — they get identical protection.
Zscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL. You get full protection from web and Internet threats. And with a cloud platform that supports Cloud Sandboxing, Next-Generation Firewall, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Cloud Application Visibility and Control, you can start with the services you need today and activate others as your needs grow.
All these capabilities are delivered from the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, the world’s largest security cloud, which processes more than 30 billion requests a day. With over 100 patents, the Zscaler platform has been architected from the ground up as a truly distributed, multi-tenant cloud with enterprise performance and scale.",2018-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,Stephen Kovac,fedramp@zscaler.com,2017-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,2020-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,Federal Trade Commission,https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/Agency_logos/US-FederalTradeCommission-Seal.png,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,F1603047866,,,,,,https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/Agency_logos/US-FCC-Seal.png,,,,,,F1512167750,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,F1508207205,FR1719759604,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was developed to bridge the gap between government agencies and their vendor and grant applicant/recipient communities in order to streamline the process of doing business with government. Through the FedConnect portal, Federal Government representatives are able to issue opportunity requests and make awards via the internet. Company representatives are able to review opportunities, submit bids or proposals, and receive awards. FedConnect provides an open channel of communication with the government that is both secure and auditable.
There are three types of government opportunities facilitated through FedConnect: traditional eRFX issuance, Reverse Auction events, and Financial Assistance opportunities, e.g. grants. For eRFX and Financial Assistance opportunities, FedConnect is offered by subscription fee to Federal Government agencies that are federally regulated. For Reverse Auction only, there is no subscription fee to Federal Government agencies. The bidding and winning vendor company is responsible for payment upon award.
On the government side, FedConnect is accessed through a system-to-system interface to the Unison Contracting and Grants software applications, where Government procurement and grant representatives become indirect users of FedConnect.
On the Vendor/Applicant side, FedConnect is accessed via the internet with a browser. Anyone can access the FedConnect web site and review public opportunities. However, to receive directed opportunities that are not publicly issued, respond electronically, and receive ongoing communications, a vendor/applicant must be registered.

The offering consists several managed services to facilitate hosting federal applications in a secure environment. The solution provided is a multi-tenant cloud-based environment, with the option for deployment of single-tenant environments if required by specific customers and system owners.
Contegix offers a managed hosting service that empowers customers to retain complete control over the application environment, while dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with in-house administration. Contegix solutions are designed to provide end-to-end managed hosting - from software, server, and network support, including setup, configuration, upgrades, monitoring, and troubleshooting. SecureCloud supports the following technologies within the tenant space: CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, Ubuntu, and Microsoft Windows Server. Contegix provisions customers’ instances with Apache, PHP, MySQL, IIS, .net, Active Directory, SQL Server, Oracle Database, LDAP and other technologies on behalf of the customer.
Contegix manages the customer tenant from the application down to the infrastructure as defined by Platform as a Service (PaaS). Within SecureCloud, tenants automatically get monitoring, security hardening, Operating System management and patching, managed backups, and managed firewalls. Contegix manages up to the application code including approved configuration changes for the system owner. Security is at the forefront of SecureCloud and with that focus, Contegix manages patching of operating systems as well as services that serve application code such as web services, database services, but does not patch the application code itself.
Disaster recovery is done at the tenant level for SecureCloud customers as PaaS allows for this to be the most efficient. Other disaster recovery techniques can be used to meet requirements as needed however, the agency can define in a statement of work what level of recovery that is needed for the system.
Enterprise managed hosting and services distributes applications across multiple servers and/or firewalls within the tenant environment. Enterprise managed hosting and services delivers optimum performance for high-volume, mission-critical business systems solutions that require the highest level of availability and scalability.

The major services provided are Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) and Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), Call Recording for Quality Assurance and WorkForce Management to optimize staff to customer requests.
**Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM)**
Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) is the core call processing software for the Cisco Unified Communications System. It builds call processing capabilities on top of a Cisco IP network infrastructure. CUCM software extends enterprise telephony features and capabilities to packet telephony network devices such as IP phones, media processing devices, voice gateways, and multimedia applications. Cisco Unified Communications delivers fully integrated communications by enabling data, voice, and video to be transmitted over a single network infrastructure. CUCM will be deployed in the Multisite WAN with centralized call processing model, with the CUCM residing in two TTEC Cloud data centers.
**Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE)**
Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise delivers intelligent contact routing, call treatment, network-to-desktop computer telephony integration (CTI), and multichannel contact management over an IP infrastructure. It combines multichannel automatic call distributor (ACD) functionality with IP telephony in a unified solution.
**Cisco Unity Connection**
Cisco Unity® Connection is a unified messaging and voicemail solution that accelerates collaboration by providing flexible message access options management simplicity. Cisco Unity Connection is robust and secure and is designed for complex distributed global deployments with support for high availability, redundancy, and branch-office survivability. It is fully virtualized and runs on Cisco Unified Computing System™ (Cisco UCS®) or on hardware that meets minimum specifications prescribed by Cisco.
**Cisco Emergency Responder (CER) - 911**
Cisco Emergency Responder provides IP phone tracking to ensure 911 emergency calls are routed correctly even when moved from its home location. Once a 911 call is made from a tracked phone, the CER system will deliver the call to the proper PSAP and alert onsite security staff. The CER cluster works in a redundant fashion with a server at each data center.
**Cisco Voice Portal (CVP)**
Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) provides the Interactive Voice Response functions for the platform. CVP will be deployed using the “Comprehensive” functional deployment model. This deployment model facilitates routing and transfers across the VoIP network, and in the future will allow CVP to act as a queuing point for calls when no agents are available in the requested skill group, as well as skill based warm transfers between Contact Center agents. **Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (CUIC)**
Cisco Unified Intelligence Center is a web-based reporting application that provides real-time and historical reporting in an easy-to-use, wizard-based application for Cisco Contact Center products. It allows contact center supervisors and business users to report on the details of every contact across all channels in the contact center from a single interface.
**Cisco Finesse**
The Cisco Finesse agent and supervisor desktop for Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise integrates traditional contact center functions into a thin-client desktop. A critical characteristic is that every desktop is browser-based and implemented through a Web 2.0 interface. No client-side installations are required. This reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO). The Cisco Finesse server is deployed on a dedicated VMware virtual machine (VM) that runs on the Cisco Voice Operating System (VOS) platform. The Cisco Finesse software is fault-tolerant and deploys on redundant VMs. Both Cisco Finesse servers are simultaneously active. One Cisco Finesse server acts as a publisher and replicates configuration data to the subscriber in the redundant pair.
**Humanify Portal**
Humanify Portal provides easy access to your contact center and unified communications administrative and management tools from a single interface. It is an exclusive application to TTEC’s Humanify Enterprise – Government (Humanify G) product that increases the flexibility of the Cisco Contact Center as a Service platform. It allows end-user administrators to perform Move, Add, Change, and Delete (MACD) activities for phones, personnel, locations, skill groups, agent teams and many other elements of the system. It also allows administrators to make changes to routing rules, IVR prompts, and call queues. This customizable, user-friendly interface allows for the administration of contact center interactions, employees and productivity at your fingertips, enabling real-time control over customer experience outcomes. You can also increase the agility of managing your contact center operations with Humanify Portal Mobile, a 100% web-based application for on-the-move access.
**Quality Assurance / Call Recording / Desktop Screen Recording**
The Humanify Enterprise for Government System records 100% of voice calls and 15% of contact center agent desktop screen recordings for compliance, transaction verification, and legal protection. Data is stored in an FedRAMP encrypted format and available for playback and analysis, and for agent performance scoring.
**Workforce Management**
Provides forecasting, multi-skill scheduling, and real-time adherence for contact center agents.

Cofense PhishMe™ is a cloud-based software solution that enables organizations to improve employee resiliency to phishing attacks by providing a turnkey platform for running simulated real-life phishing scenarios.

Cofense PhishMe has the largest installed base of Federal government users of any solution in the simulation and awareness training category. More than 2000 of world’s largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on Cofense PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks.

Once certified, Cofense PhishMe will achieve FedRAMP Moderate Authorization, an important milestone meeting the security baselines for more than 300 controls.  According to FedRAMP, Moderate Impact Authorization “is most appropriate for CSOs where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effects on an agency’s operations, assets, or individuals […] including significant operational damage to agency assets, financial loss, or individual harm that is not loss of life or physical.”  For comparison, solutions achieving FedRAMP Low Authorization are only required to address 125 controls, while organizations obtaining the FedRAMP LI-SaaS Authorization are responsible for just 38 controls.

**More about Cofense PhishMe**

The system enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails.
 
For example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their banking credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, Cofense PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that actual phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future.

To maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:

* PhishMe content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.
* Responsive Delivery: Cofense PhishMe allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. 
* Playbooks: Cofense PhishMe includes predefined Playbooks, with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices.

Cofense PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks—the leading cause of data breaches—through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.",,Sylvain Lacroix,federal@cofense.com,2020-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/Agency_logos/US-DeptOfHHS-Seal.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Everlaw platform provides three primary capabilities, enabling organizations to: 

* Discover: Ingest, organize, search through, and review massive troves of data in order to discover and produce relevant underlying information.
* Reveal: Harness the power of modern computer science to expose the hidden details of documents at scale. 
* Act: Collaborate securely with colleagues, business partners, inside or outside counsel to craft narratives and efficiently manage the end-to-end process of investigations or litigation.

Document Search: Everlaw's instantaneous search results occur with even the most complex search strings. The ability to visually build searches allows both novice and power users to narrow their searches without concern of the elusive missing parenthesis.

Document Review: Providing exceptionally fast 'doc-to-doc' review speeds and shortcuts like coding presets, users are able to complete their review significantly more quickly on Everlaw. Productions: Everlaw provides a cloud-based production environment that can generate, modify and share legal document productions at any time.

The Exterro Platform is a single, natively built, fully integrated solution that unifies all of Exterro's E-Discovery and Information Governance products. Further, it includes our integration hub, which connects to the industry's broadest range of 3rd party tools, system applications, and data sources, orchestrating processes across applications and minimizing your cost of ownership.
Products within The Exterro Platform:
**Employee Change Monitor**
Employee Change Monitor enables you to proactively take steps to mitigate risk associated with the change in any data field stored in your HR information system and shared with the Exterro Platform. For example, when an employee leaves your organization, a task can be issued to take a snapshot of her email box and backup her files, a system notification can be sent to alert Records Management of the change in employment status, and the employee can automatically be released from any active legal holds.
**File Analysis**
Exterro File Analysis provides the critical foundation for any Information Governance project by delivering the information you need to achieve your cost and risk reduction efforts. Intuitive and data-rich dashboards in Exterro's File Analysis software display key information about the content stored on your data sources such as network shares and SharePoint servers. Key document properties such as date created, last modified, access rights, metadata, and content type are displayed, providing the critical foundation for all your information governance cost and risk reduction activities. Proactively manage policies that support organizational goals by gaining insight into the content that matters most. Easily identify data that has business or legal value, such as sensitive data (e.g. personally identifiable or health information), files found outside retention guidelines or ESI on legal hold, to make informed business decisions.
**Data Mapping**
Build and maintain an up-to-date directory that mirrors your evolving data source inventory with Exterro Data Mapping. Identify important ESI repositories, eliminate irrelevant ones, and meet the most rigorous judicial and compliance standards.
**Legal Hold**
Say goodbye to manual, time consuming, and error-prone litigation hold processes with world-class legal hold software. With Exterro Legal Hold, you can:
* Manage the entire legal hold process - from notifications, to interviews, to reminders, and more - in one place
* Protect and secure data from accidental deletion with the In-Place Preservation module
* Integrate with your HR system, and get notified of employee status changes, to mitigate the risk of spoliation and automate other operational processes with the Employee Change Monitor module
* Quickly identify critical information from custodian data stored in Microsoft Office 365 prior to collection with the Office 365 Explorer module
**In-Place Early Case Assessment**
Perform early case assessment through a broad set of analytic and predictive intelligence capabilities that enable rapid identification of the most important documents in a dataset prior to collection. Uncover crucial documents and communications prior to 26(f) conferences to support your proportionality and strategic arguments.
**Collection and Processing**
Perform targeted collections and full e-discovery document review with a “one-click” ability to collect only the relevant files that are identified during ECA. Exterro supports the ability to connect to an ever growing list of 30+ on premises and cloud-based data sources, eliminating the need to send requests to multiple stakeholders to perform collections. Exterro is unique in the market by combining processing with collection and offering documents for review almost immediately after the collection process is started, thus saving you time and money while reducing risk associated with manual handoffs and promotions. In addition, our underlying technology has been built with the future in mind, able to easily and quickly process vast amounts of data without impacting performance for your users.

**Artifical Intelligence (AI) in eDiscovery**
Modus is partnering with the most powerful AI providers in the industry to enable these powerful analytics tools for the eDiscovery environment. Government Agencies interested in this technology can utilize their relationship with Modus to pursue these powerful tools in your eDiscovery objectives.
**Discovery Production**
As electronically stored information has become more diverse and voluminous, the specificity and complexity of production formats has similarly increased. Today, productions may be required in a variety of formats, including native, PDF, and TIFF, with or without intricate load files, extracted text, and other features. Conforming, precisely and consistently, to mandated production specifications is an essential component of eDiscovery success.
Modus’ production services include:
* Native Production
* PDF Production
* TIFF Production
* Hybrid Production
* Custom Load File Creation
* Slipsheet/Placeholder Generation
* Endorsements and Bates Numbering
**Data Collection and Forensics**
The collection of potentially relevant materials – whether physically or electronically stored – is a critical early step in the eDiscovery process. Successful execution of a collection requires the maintenance of both forensic soundness and the chain of custody from source to production, as well as the tools and experience to collect from today’s ever-multiplying range of sources. Modus’ collection services include: * Evidence Identification
* Data Harvesting & Forensic Collection
* Forensic Imaging
* Live & Targeted Data Acquisitions
* Preservation
* Analysis
**eDiscovery Processing**
To facilitate hosted review and production, all collected electronically stored information must be processed. Such materials can come in hundreds of different formats, with different properties, different metadata, and potentially, different nested content. Processing finds and expands nested content, captures and organizes metadata, and extracts and normalizes text for review and production. Modus processing services enable you to use our hosted review platform or your own. We’ve built processing templates for all of the leading ECA and review tools to ensure you get pristine loads and fast, accurate and consistent processing no matter which downstream tools you are using. And, we can quickly customize or build a new template to meet your requirements. Processing Types Including:

Deployed in AWS GovCloud and built to meet federal security requirements, Federal Archive enables agencies to capture, archive, access and produce text message communications quickly and efficiently.
Supported channels include AT&T and Verizon, with additional communication channels on the roadmap.
Records Managers, CTOs, CIOs and IT staff will appreciate secure, centralized, automated digital content combined with powerful search and retrieval capabilities in a single solution. Onboarding is simple, scalable and cost-effi­cient. Federal Archive has been designed to protect agencies now and in the future, providing peace of mind in a constantly evolving regulatory landscape.
Key capabilities to manage government communications records include:
* Direct, Contextual Capture: All content is captured directly from AT&T and Verizon via API connections. Messages are captured with full context and metadata, rather than being flattened to email format. Upon ingestion into the archive, content is easily accessible and ready to be leveraged for high speed search and export.
* Powerful Search: Industry-leading search speeds are supported, regardless of the volume of ingested data. Search results are displayed with message threading and attachments to maintain the full context of each conversation.
* High Speed Exports: Any/all messages and message metadata can be exported from the platform at high speed. Exports are password protected and export history logs can be displayed in the platform for reference or repeat downloads. Messages can also be exported from search results – either the full search list or a subset of selected messages.
* External Archive Functionality: In addition to its integrated archive, Federal Archive provides clients with the option to capture content and send it directly to an external archive in EML or SFTP format.
* Advanced Admin & Permissions: Within the platform, identities are unified across supported channels and are searchable by profile. Profiles can be filtered based on whether they are internal or external, by person or organization and/or by channel. Admins have a dashboard view of their organization’s archived channels as well as the provisioning status of each channel for enhanced oversight.
* Federal Grade Security: Federal Archive will be deployed in AWS GovCloud. Built specifically for government agencies, GovCloud hosts sensitive data and regulated workflows with the most stringent security and compliance controls. Amazon’s physical and other security controls have been architected to meet the specific requirements of government agencies. The platform adheres to top-tier security standards, with all captured data encrypted in transit and at rest.

The Veracode Application Security Services System (VASSS) is designed to assist organizations in verifying an application’s security state and in determining acceptable levels of risk before the software is deployed for business use. In conjunction with providing these services, Veracode relies upon its Center for Software Assurance (CSA) function to perform quality review procedures over the results generated by the Platform System prior to delivering them to its clients.
**Enterprise-grade Security**
The Veracode cloud-based platform provides customers a centralized way to secure web, mobile and third-party applications across their global infrastructure, from development to production, without slowing innovation.
**White Box Testing / Binary Static Analysis (SAST)**
Static Application Security Testing (SAST), or “white-box” testing, finds common vulnerabilities by performing a deep analysis of customer applications without executing them. Using Veracode patented binary SAST technology, all code is analyzed, including open source and third-party components, without requiring access to source code.
SAST supplements threat modeling and code reviews performed by developers, finding coding errors and omissions more quickly and at lower cost via automation. It’s typically run in the early phases of the Software Development Lifecycle when it’s easier and less expensive to fix problems prior to production deployment.
**Black Box Testing / Dynamic Analysis (DAST)**
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), or “black-box” testing, identifies architectural weaknesses and vulnerabilities in customer running web applications. DAST allows customers to test and secure applications prior to and after shipping.
**Web Application Perimeter Monitoring**
Most enterprises don’t even know how many public-facing applications they have. To reduce customers’ global application threat surface, Veracode’s parallel cloud infrastructure rapidly discovers public-facing applications and identifies the potential exploitable vulnerabilities.
As enterprises spin-up new websites for new marketing campaigns or geographies, create web portals for customers and partners, and acquire companies, web application perimeters are constantly expanding. Additionally, legacy and aging marketing sites may exist unknowingly. The Veracode platform allows customers to quickly identify risks and take immediate action by shutting down legacy sites. Customers can also feed security intelligence about specific vulnerabilities from the Veracode cloud-based platform to your existing WAFs, for rapid mitigation via virtual patching.
**Vendor Application Security Testing**
Driving innovation to market usually means trusting the resilience of third-party software. The VAST program leaves less to chance. It baselines the risk posed by third-party applications and components, and then works directly with vendors to ensure your software supply chain is in compliance with your corporate policies.
**Mobile Application Security System**
Veracode’s cloud-based solution helps mobile teams achieve the correct balance between innovation and control. Veracode helps effectively manage the security risk posed by the mobile apps that customer organizations build, buy or download. Veracode’s solution provides the intelligence to protect against attacks and verify compliance with corporate risk and privacy policies.
Veracode’s mobile application security solution combines automated code assessments with expert remediation services that enable IT teams to rapidly secure mobile applications in agile development environments, without slowing innovation.",,Prasad Dorbala,pdorbala@veracode.com,2019-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/Agency_logos/SEC%20Logo.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**The first major breakthrough in secure remote access since the VPN**
Zscaler is a leader in securing Internet traffic for enterprises around the globe, with a cloud-based security platform designed to protect enterprise Internet traffic with Secure Web Gateway, Cloud Application Visibility and Control, Cloud Sandboxing, Data Loss Prevention, and more. Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets.
Zscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience.
With Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service.
Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.
**Improve your security posture even as you provide seamless access**
The reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.
**Connect by application, not by IP address**
VPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
Eliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment
As part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your “client sprawl” by delivering a
single app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more.
Take your applications from “on-net” to “dark- net,” at the same time YOU get complete visibility. Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unroutable to anyone. But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never before been possible. Once you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are actually running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected! And once you know what applications are running, you can easily create granular access rules for them.
App Discovery makes deployment easy.",,Stephen Kovac,fedramp@zscaler.com,2020-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-08-30T04:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
