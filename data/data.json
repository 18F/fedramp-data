ARC-P is a KVM based cloud system that assures interoperability and support for multiple hypervisor images. Agency virtualized images can be imported and exported from the ARC-P environment at agency request. ARC-P can support large numbers of agency virtual machines with the ability to scale services up and down according to agency customers’ varying requirements. ARC-P IaaS offers additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk image library, raw (block) and file-based storage, customer virtual network (CVN) separation at layer 2, firewalls, load balancers, public facing IP addresses, and software bundles. ARC-P IaaS supplies elastic compute resources on-demand from ARC-P compute pools installed in our CONUS only data centers. For cloud environment connectivity, agencies can use available ARC-P VPN solutions over the Internet or dedicated carrier clouds and circuits.\n\n\n**ARC-P GPC** offers the same features as ARC-P GCC with additional logical and physical separation for private cloud environments that require a dedicated hardware stack.\n\n**ARC-P SDC** (Secure Data Center) service provides agencies and government contractors secure IT system colocation services to assist with federal data center consolidation mandates along with their cloud first requirements. ARC-P SDC allows government customers to collocate their non-virtualized and legacy IT systems, as well as IT systems and private cloud stacks in which an agency or government contractor wishes to develop, deploy, and manage the full IT stack within the ARC-P FedRAMP JAB authorized Security Authorization Boundary, with the ability to leverage and inherit those ARC-P security controls that apply specifically to the physical environment and physical security of our facilities. Autonomic Resources is responsible for the physical security and physical environmental controls associated with each provided private cage and provides space, power, and any needed network cross-connects to other environments or circuits provided by the customer, to their hosted virtual environments within the ARC-P IaaS Government Community Cloud or ARC-P Government Private Cloud stacks. Data Center facility providers can engage Autonomic Resources for accreditation of their space under ARC-P SDC.",

This infrastructure and platform service offering is a highly secure, enterprise-class, cloud computing environment enabling government agencies, contractors and non-government organizations governed by federal regulations (e.g.: educational institutions, HIPAA-governed entities, and critical infrastructure ) to operate in the cloud with greater agility and flexibility while adhering to rigorous security, privacy, and IT governance controls required by the federal government.\n\nHPE Helion for Public Sector consists of multiple components that can exist in a single cloud or operate within multiple clouds:\n\n- Infrastructure-as- a-Service (IaaS): allows consumers to build and manage Windows, Linux and/or UNIX services to host system middleware or applications they install and manage  themselves. The service enables users to quickly provision both virtual and physical servers in a consumption- based model. The service also allows clients to co-locate customer-owned physical devices such as RISC chipset servers or hardware security modules (MSM) in the same data center as their cloud servers. \n- Platform-as- a-Service (PaaS): allows consumers to extend the shared security model and eliminate operational expenses associated with the management of operating systems,    middleware, databases and security. HPE manages client workloads, reducing the    management burden and mitigating an overinvestment in infrastructure, while deploying new managed services securely within a FedRAMP-authorized and DISA ECSB-approved environment. \n- Disaster Recovery-as- a-Service (DRaaS): enables consumers to implement a disaster recovery capability to meet federal, state and local requirements for contingency planning. This solution    automatically collects and maintains complete images of the servers and network in their cloud, and can restore the entire cloud without client intervention. This managed service also    includes assistance with disaster recovery planning and annual DR rehearsals. Government       agencies can benefit from HPE’s service excellence and over 50 years of public sector experience, with a solution built from the ground up with security and best practices in mind. The service is hosted exclusively in auditable data centers in the continental United States, and is staffed by U.S. persons.\n\nHPE Helion for Public Sector complies with the following regulatory standards:\n\n- FIPS 140-2 encryption (Federal Information Processing Standards 140-2 encryption)\n- FedRAMP tailored CIS Level 1 configuration benchmarks (Center for Internet Security Level 1) \n- HIPAA/HITECH Security and Privacy (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act/ Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health)\n- ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations)\n- FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)\n- PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)\n- CJIS (Criminal Justice Information System)\n- FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)\n- DIACAP/DIARMF (DoD Information Assurance Certification and  Accreditation Process/Defense Information Assurance Risk Management Framework)\n- DoD Cloud Security Reference Guide (SRG) Information Impact level 2 (authorized 10/27/14)\n\nFor more information, visit our web site for the U.S. public sector at [www.hpe.com/gov/transformation](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hpe/gov-transformation/overview.html) or our worldwide web site at [www.hpe.com](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html).",

Its web interface offers fully secure email archiving with robust search and discovery, supervision, and enforcement features. The solution securely stores electronic messages for a specified retention period, while keeping the messages fully searchable and retrievable in real-time or with a batch process. This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user’s email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\n\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with *Proofpoint’s DoubleBlind™ Encryption* technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.\n\n*Proofpoint’s DoubleBlind™ Encryption* technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE’s web-based user interface. Data can never be viewed without access to both the archiving CPE within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment and the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment.",

Our platform enables agencies to foster greater digital engagement with citizens and securely deliver mission essential information and services with greater speed, agility, and resiliency.\n\nThe City of LA, State of New York, FEMA, Department of Homeland Security and many other government agencies rely on the Acquia platform to build websites and digital experiences that meet the needs of their citizens, internal users and IT teams while moving their missions forward.\n\nThese agencies know that a citizen-centric government requires more than simply taking the existing physical structure and making it digital. Today the term “digital” has taken on a new meaning. In the private sector, consumers can shop, pay bills, and even conduct banking online, and now they’re expecting to conduct government business online in the same way. The most forward-thinking government IT managers are finding ways to meet expectations set by the private sector, and then going above and beyond to serve citizens.\n\nWith the Acquia Platform governments and agencies can use limited taxpayer dollars efficiently to build sites and experience that meet the needs of IT, deliver on the mission and give citizens crucial information they need.",

FedConnect is a Federal acquisition and grants portal where vendors and grant applicants can find opportunities for federal contracts, grants, and other types of assistance funding. It was developed to bridge the gap between government agencies and their vendor and grant applicant/recipient communities in order to streamline the process of doing business with government. Through the FedConnect portal Federal Government representatives are able to issue opportunity requests and make awards via the internet. Company representatives are able to review opportunities, submit bids or proposals, and receive awards. FedConnect provides an open channel of communication with the government that is both secure and auditable.\n\nThere are three types of government opportunities facilitated through FedConnect: traditional eRFX issuance, Reverse Auction events, and Financial Assistance opportunities, e.g. grants. For eRFX and Financial Assistance opportunities, FedConnect is offered by subscription fee to Federal Government agencies that are federally regulated. For Reverse Auction only, there is no subscription fee to Federal Government agencies. The bidding and winning vendor company is responsible for payment upon award.\n\nOn the government side, FedConnect is accessed through a system-to-system interface to the Compusearch Acquisition and Grants Management software application, PRISM. Through PRISM, Government procurement and grant representatives become indirect users of FedConnect.\n\nOn the Vendor/Applicant side, FedConnect is accessed via the internet with a browser. Anyone can access the FedConnect web site and review public opportunities. However, to receive directed opportunities that are not publicly issued, respond electronically, and receive ongoing communications, a vendor/applicant must be registered.\n\nTo learn more about FedConnect and its capabilities, please visit the public portion of the FedConnect site at [https://www.fedconnect.net.](https://www.fedconnect.net)",

Customers can engage resources in an a la carte, and “pay for performance” model that allows them to know exactly what to expect – It’s the technology you need, when you need it.\n\nAll infrastructure resources are managed and monitored through the KPS tool “Zeus”, which is included within the boundaries of the CloudSeed system, and gives customers the ability to view and manage cloud resources across the full range of possible KPS cloud deployments – Public, Federal Community, and Private - as well as across multiple CSPs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and on-premise virtualization technologies (ESXi, KVM, etc.).  By providing customers this single pane of glass to both view and manage all of their infrastructure solutions, Zeus allows for true “hybrid” cloud solutions that can combine pre-existing customer solutions with new cloud-based solutions.  Zeus gives customers a truly \"holistic\" view into their infrastructure, and allows them to move workloads across solutions as-needed to address specific business requirements.\n\nThe technical architecture that makes up CloudSeed is also available via the KPS Public Cloud for both Federal and Commercial customers, as well as in private cloud deployments on a customer's premises or in KPS' FedRAMP compliant data center.  This architecture providers cheap, efficient, and reliable clouds by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and automatically and instantly recognizing every piece of hardware that is plugged into the system as simply Compute, Storage, or Network resources.  In other words, KPS customers are able to use their pre-existing equipment as the basis for their own private cloud deployment simply by connecting it to the system via ethernet or fiber cable.  Through this technology, customers are able to instantiate an entire cloud from scratch in under 20 minutes while re-using many of the same technical controls implemented in Knight Point's Federal Cloud, giving them previously unparalleled flexibility in their cloud deployments.",

PRISM provides federal and defense acquisition communities with the tools needed to effectively support the complete acquisition management lifecycle, from initial planning and requisitioning through source selection, award, post award management, and closeout. PRISM brings together key stakeholders – the program office staff, contracting professionals, and financial managers – and links them as a community for greater efficiency, productivity, and operational transparency.  Because PRISM was designed from the ground up to serve the Federal acquisition community, it comes with all necessary interfaces to the rest of the Federal integrated acquisition environment, maintains FARS and DFARS clauses, and incorporates Federal regulatory changes into general maintenance. \n\nPRISM directly supports collaboration by providing the ability to set up collaborative team spaces where you can define the people who participate on the acquisition team and the roles that they will play. Collaborative team spaces help increase communication between the program office and the contracting teams to improve process efficiency and eliminate the delays often associated with incomplete or inaccurate packages, duplicate data entry, and lack of visibility throughout the process. \n\nPRISM’s web interface streamlines processes and organizes content and functions so that they are logical and intuitive. PRISM’s user-centric approach increases productivity and efficiency and reduces user adoption time. Integrated guidance and field level help can be configured by your organization to support a wide range of users with varying levels of capabilities.  ",

Email-based attacks, in particular spear phishing, remain one of the primary methods used to initiate an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack because of the complexity involved in detecting them. To protect against malicious emails, organizations simply route messages to the Email Threat Prevention Cloud. The cloud analyzes the emails for spam and known viruses first. It then uses the signature-less FireEye Multi-vector Virtual Execution™ (MVX) engine to analyze attachments and URLs to detect threats and stop APT attacks in real time.\n\n**Easy deployment and cross-enterprise protection**\n\nWithout hardware or software to install, the Email Threat Prevention Cloud is a particularly good fit for organizations seeking to move their infrastructure into the cloud. This eliminates the complexity of procuring, installing, and managing a physical infrastructure.\n\nEmail Threat Prevention Cloud integrates with the entire FireEye portfolio for real-time threat intelligence sharing. This rich correlation of threat intelligence provides organizations several unique capabilities, such as:\n\n - Identifying previous targets of spear-phishing emails \n - Locating copies of the malicious email in target inboxes \n - Finding out if the message is being forwarded to new targets\n - Highlighting URLs that become malicious after message delivery\n\nFor added accessibility and ease-of-use, the dashboard shows region- and industry-based malware trends, and audit logging.",

        "CSO_Description": "**Veracode Application Security Services System**\n\nThe Veracode Application Security Services System (VASSS) is designed to assist organizations in verifying an application’s security state and in determining acceptable levels of risk before the software is deployed for business use. In conjunction with providing these services, Veracode relies upon its Center for Software Assurance (CSA) function to perform quality review procedures over the results generated by the Platform System prior to delivering them to its clients.\n\n**Enterprise-grade Security**\n \nThe Veracode cloud-based platform provides customers a centralized way to secure web, mobile and third-party applications across their global infrastructure, from development to production, without slowing innovation.\n\n**White Box Testing / Binary Static Analysis (SAST)**\n\nStatic Application Security Testing (SAST), or “white-box” testing, finds common vulnerabilities by performing a deep analysis of customer applications without executing them. Using Veracode patented binary SAST technology, all code is analyzed, including open source and third-party components, without requiring access to source code.\n\nSAST supplements threat modeling and code reviews performed by developers, finding coding errors and omissions more quickly and at lower cost via automation. It’s typically run in the early phases of the Software Development Lifecycle when it’s easier and less expensive to fix problems prior to production deployment.\n\n**Black Box Testing / Dynamic Analysis (DAST)**\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), or “black-box” testing, identifies architectural weaknesses and vulnerabilities in customer running web applications. DAST allows customers to test and secure applications prior to and after shipping.\n\n**Web Application Perimeter Monitoring**\n\nMost enterprises don’t even know how many public-facing applications they have. To reduce customers’ global application threat surface, Veracode’s parallel cloud infrastructure rapidly discovers public-facing applications and identifies the potential exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\nAs enterprises spin-up new websites for new marketing campaigns or geographies, create web portals for customers and partners, and acquire companies, web application perimeters are constantly expanding. Additionally, legacy and aging marketing sites may exist unknowingly. The Veracode platform allows customers to quickly identify risks and take immediate action by shutting down legacy sites. Customers can also feed security intelligence about specific vulnerabilities from the Veracode cloud-based platform to your existing WAFs, for rapid mitigation via virtual patching.\n\n**Vendor Application Security Testing**\n\nDriving innovation to market usually means trusting the resilience of third-party software. The VAST program leaves less to chance. It baselines the risk posed by third-party applications and components, and then works directly with vendors to ensure your software supply chain is in compliance with your corporate policies.\n\n**Mobile Application Security System**\n\nVeracode’s cloud-based solution helps mobile teams achieve the correct balance between innovation and control. Veracode helps effectively manage the security risk posed by the mobile apps that customer organizations build, buy or download. Veracode’s solution provides the intelligence to protect against attacks and verify compliance with corporate risk and privacy policies.\n\nVeracode’s mobile application security solution combines automated code assessments with expert remediation services that enable IT teams to rapidly secure mobile applications in agile development environments, without slowing innovation.",

        "CSO_Description": "**ZSCALER PRIVATE ACCESS**\n\n**The first major breakthrough in secure remote access since the VPN**\n\nZscaler is a leader in securing Internet traffic for enterprises around the globe, with a cloud-based security platform designed to protect enterprise Internet traffic with Secure Web Gateway, Cloud Application Visibility and Control, Cloud Sandboxing, Data Loss Prevention, and more. Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets.\n\nZscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience.\n\nWith Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service.\n\nZscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.\n\n**Improve your security posture even as you provide seamless access**\n\nThe reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.\n\n**Connect by application, not by IP address**\n\nVPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks.\n\nEliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment\n\nAs part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your “client sprawl” by delivering a\nsingle app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more.\n\nTake your applications from “on-net” to “dark- net,” at the same time YOU get complete visibility.  Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unroutable to anyone.  But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never before been possible. Once you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are actually running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected! And once you know what applications are running, you can easily create granular access rules for them.\n\nApp Discovery makes deployment easy.",

        "CSO_Description": "Zscaler Internet Access delivers your security stack as a service from the cloud, eliminating the cost and complexity of traditional secure web gateway approaches. By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.\n\n**The Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security**\n\nThe data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations.\n\nHowever, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today’s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances — and their associated costs — are out of control. Furthermore, it’s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.\n\n**Zscaler Internet Access**\n\nZscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp — all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect — a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office — they get identical protection.\n\nZscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL. You get full protection from web and Internet threats. And with a cloud platform that supports Cloud Sandboxing, Next-Generation Firewall, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Cloud Application Visibility and Control, you can start with the services you need today and activate others as your needs grow.\n\nAll these capabilities are delivered from the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, the world’s largest security cloud, which processes more than 30 billion requests a day. With over 100 patents, the Zscaler platform has been architected from the ground up as a truly distributed, multi-tenant cloud with enterprise performance and scale.",
