        "CSO_Description": "Armis, FedRAMP Edition (AFE) is an agentless, enterprise-class security platform purpose-built to help organizations discover and secure managed, unmanaged, and IoT devices, including medical devices and industrial control systems (ICS).. Armis discovers every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in any environment, analyzes device behavior to identify risks, vulnerabilities or attacks, and protects critical business information and systems. Armis easily integrates with existing security products.\rAFE passively monitors wired and wireless traffic in the environment to identify every device and to understand its behavior without disruption. AFE analyzes this data in the AFE Risk Engine which uses device profiles and characteristics from the AFE Device Knowledgebase to identify each device, assess its risks & vulnerabilities, detect threats, and recommend remediation actions.\r**Visibility**\rAFE closes the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Dashboard visibility gap with unmanaged and IoT devices. AFE discovers and classifies every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in the environment including servers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP phones, smart TVs, IP cameras, printers, 5G, HVAC controls, medical devices, industrial controls, and more. AFE can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other protocols in any environment. The comprehensive device inventory that AFE generates includes critical information such as device manufacturer, model, serial number, location, username, operating system, installed applications, and connections made over time. In addition to discovering and classifying a device, AFE calculates its risk score based on factors such as vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, as well as the behaviors observed of each device in the environment. This risk score helps security teams understand their attack surface and meet compliance with regulatory frameworks that require identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities.\r**Insights**\nThe AFE Risk Engine continuously monitors the behavior of every device in the environment for behavioral anomalies. Working with the AFE Device Knowledgebase, AFE compares the real-time behavior of each device with:\r* Historical device behavior\r* Behavior of similar devices in the Customer's environment\r* Behavior of similar devices in other environments\r* Common attack techniques\r* Information from threat intelligence feeds\r**Actions**\rWith these types of critical device and behavioral insights, AFE is able to identify threats and attacks.\rWhen AFE detects a threat, it can alert security teams and trigger automated action to stop an attack. Through integrations with network infrastructure, as well as the Customer's existing security enforcement points like Cisco and Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and network access control (NAC) products such as Cisco ISE and Aruba ClearPass, AFE can restrict access or quarantine suspicious or malicious devices.\r**Easy Integration**\nAFE requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy. AFE integrates with existing firewalls or NAC, security management systems such as SIEM, ticketing systems, and asset databases. These integrations allow AFE to leverage existing investments to achieve greater value and more automated response.",

Vaulting away shared account passwords, application passwords, and secrets is just one of the best practices to secure privileged access. Managing the vaulted credentials, leveraging secure administrative access via a distributed local jump box, establishing VPN-less privileged session to remotely access targeted infrastructure, and implementing multi-factor authentication are at the root of reducing threats, intentional or not. Centrify PAS allows for all the above, as well as enables agencies to authenticate internal and outsourced IT users through Active Directory, LDAP, or other cloud identity stores. Agencies can use one or any combination of these identity stores or grant granular, federated privileged access to resources for partners and third-party vendors. Ultimately, Centrify PAS grants access from a Web UI or mobile app and covers an agency’s entire attack surface, both on-premises and in the cloud. Centrify PAS minimizes the attack surface, improves audit and compliance visibility, and reduces risk, complexity, and costs. Centrify PAS seamlessly integrates with Centrify’s other solutions, namely the Centrify Authentication Service (which helps verify who requests privileged access by leveraging enterprise directory identities rather than local accounts) and Centrify Privilege Elevation Service (which enables host-based enforcement of just enough, just-in-time privileged access best practices).",

Webex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government consists of an integrated, cloud-based feature set of core and optional components that provide for Auto Call Distribution (ACD), Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Computer Telephony Integration (CTI), outbound services, reporting, mobile applications, and IP telephony—all on an omnichannel basis. Solution features include:\n**Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)**\n* Routing services based on Cisco’s Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) technology.\n* **ACD functionality** which allows collection and routing of calls to a contact center agent; conversion of calls to formats that can be carried by a data network to their recipient; rules-based routing; multi-skilled expert agent selection; precision routing; supervisor features; call prompting; announcements; and music-on-hold and queuing capabilities.\n* **Precision routing**, which sends the contact to the best available resource based on information about the caller and the attributes of the agent. By delivering the contact effectively, companies can reduce overall handling time, decrease the need for multiple transfers, and increase customer satisfaction with the experience. Precision routing is supported for all contact channels, including voice, video, web, chat, and email.\n* **Computer Telephony Integration (CTI):** Screen pops based on ANI or customer-entered information can be used to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n* **Queue enhancements:** includes priority within queue, announcements/prompts within the queue, redirect on no answer.\n**Agent and supervisor desktop**\nIncluded with Webex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government is the Cisco Finesse ® desktop, a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop designed to provide easy access to the applications and information your customer service organization needs through a customizable web-based interface.

These features add value to the supervisor’s role in the contact center and help them effectively manage their teams. These capabilities include:\n* **chat capabilities for supervisors and agents.** Supervisors can send chat messages to agents participating in a call, allowing supervisors to coach agents unobtrusively on cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and help agents resolve customer situations. Supervisors can interrupt an agent’s call to create a three-way conference, and then interact with both the caller and the agent to help resolve a concern. A supervisor can remove the agent from a call using the Intercept feature, allowing the supervisor and caller to complete the call on their own while the agent handles another customer request.\n* **Change an agent’s state from Supervisor desktop.** Agents may forget to make themselves available to take calls after a break or neglect to log out when away from their workstations for an extended period. Supervisors can easily log out missing agents or make unintentionally idle agents ready to take calls.\n* **Change an agent’s skill profile in real time.** This capability gives supervisors tactical tools to manage their agent teams and support contact center management objectives.\n**Administration and management portal**\nStreamlined administration allows managers to perform all contact center administration centrally. The administrative interface allows agents to be set up to handle voice, web, chat, and email contacts, depending on their assigned skill sets.\nThe interface allows system managers, administrators, and supervisors to develop, modify, or view routing scripts; manage the system configuration; monitor contact center performance; define and request reports; and help ensure system security.

With Unified CVP, you can pay a bill, order products and track delivery, locate a dealer, schedule a pickup, change name and address information, make travel arrangements, check payment status, receive notification of unusual activity, and request literature or product information. Customers can use voice commands to retrieve the information they require without ever speaking with an agent, or to quickly navigate to the correct department or agent who can help them. Unified CVP is designed to simplify business integration, increase flexibility, and provide efficiency gains. These features can reduce business costs and dramatically improve customer satisfaction.",

Secure and flexible SaaS management console allows for centralized policy-based and role-based management to ensure automated, robust and differentiated application of policies based on the user’s role. Automatic elevation of known good programs requiring elevation, including those legacy and not-UAC-aware, significantly cuts down on the IT Service Desk requests, while optional automatic access restriction (for example, network connectivity restriction) for unknown applications significantly reduces the area of attack and helps break ransomware kill chain. Out-of-the-box anti-ransomware policy allows to add additional layer of security around sensitive data and prevent data corruption even in the event of successful asset compromise and ransomware execution. Another critical capability is blocking credential, key, secret, password, hash, cookie and other sensitive information from memory, browsers, operating system and credential stores, effectively blocking most attacks based on credential compromise. Endpoint Privilege Manager helps with audit and compliance by addressing specific regulation requirements and creating audit trail for identity and privilege events on the endpoints.",

LASER also provides a human-centric user interface, enabling smooth interaction with suggestions provided by the AI.\nLASER supports classical systematic reviews as well as enables quick verification of the quality of the reviews by the regulators and the sponsors, makes it possible to perform a larger number of reviews for personalized medicine or the creation of high-quality rapid assessments in the face of epidemics or ecological disasters.\nLASER is built with larger organizations in mind, providing a high level of security as well as enterprise-grade management of projects, teams, roles, shared dictionaries, and customizable workflow processes. LASER helps with the following steps of literature reviews: creation of the review protocol, construction and execution of a search strategy, T&A screening, screening of full texts, data extraction, quality assessment, export of data to meta-analysis tools.",

They are improving their DevSecOps processes, facilitating Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and shipping more code safer than ever. LaunchDarkly enables: * Resolution of incidents in less than 200 milliseconds, without costly rollbacks that threaten other features.\r* Powerful targeting capabilities that provide complete control over which users or microservices can see new features.\r* Safe testing in production—empowering teams with real-world QA testing in place of costly pre-production environments.\r* CI/CD development processes that improve developer productivity and new feature release times.\r* Hypothesis driven development, including A/B/n experimentation and percentage rollouts.\rLaunchDarkly provides developers and business stakeholders with a central location to manage the rollout of new features. At the same time, it can enforce change management policies through scheduling, approval workflows, and custom role-based access control down to the feature level. Agencies can implement their own policies around the use of personally identifiable information (PII) and can take full advantage of targeting without needing to store user PII within the LaunchDarkly Federal SaaS environment. Additional hosting options and an offline mode are available for organizations with more restrictive policies.",

        "CSO_Description": "Zscaler Internet Access delivers your security stack as a service from the cloud, eliminating the cost and complexity of traditional secure web gateway approaches. By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.\n**The Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security**\nThe data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations.\nHowever, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today’s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances — and their associated costs — are out of control. Furthermore, it’s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.\n**Zscaler Internet Access**\nZscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp — all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect — a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office — they get identical protection.\nZscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL. You get full protection from web and Internet threats. And with a cloud platform that supports Cloud Sandboxing, Next-Generation Firewall, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Cloud Application Visibility and Control, you can start with the services you need today and activate others as your needs grow.\nAll these capabilities are delivered from the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, the world’s largest security cloud, which processes more than 30 billion requests a day. With over 100 patents, the Zscaler platform has been architected from the ground up as a truly distributed, multi-tenant cloud with enterprise performance and scale.",

        "CSO_Description": "**ZSCALER PRIVATE ACCESS The first major breakthrough in Zero Trust Networking, and is the future of remote access.** Zscaler is a leader Zero Trust Networking and securing Internet traffic for enterprises around the globe, with a cloud-based security platform designed to protect enterprise Internet traffic with Secure Web Gateway, Cloud Application Visibility and Control, Cloud Sandboxing, Data Loss Prevention, and more. Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets. Zscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience. With Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service. Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.\n**Improve your security posture even as you provide seamless access** The reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.\n**Connect by application, not by IP address** VPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate, and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Eliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment As part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your “client sprawl” by delivering a single app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more. Take your applications from “on-net” to “dark- net,” at the same time YOU get complete visibility. Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unrouteable to anyone. But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never been possible. Once you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected! And once you know what applications are running, you can easily create granular access rules for them. App Discovery makes deployment easy.",

The level of support can vary, depending on the customer’s overall readiness. For those CSPs who are unfamiliar with the FedRAMP program or are new to the Federal space, we generally start with a Compliance Review to set a baseline for them to obtain a FedRAMP authorization and to determine where their gaps are with achieving compliance. For those CSPs who already understand the FedRAMP requirements, we conduct a technical engineering review to determine if the mandatory requirements for FedRAMP are in fact met. Depending on the need, we can provide additional vulnerability scanning support to ensure inventoried assets are properly patched and configured prior to the 3PAO assessment. Once the system is fully built and operational, our team works with the CSP to document the implementation of the security controls in the System Security Plan and complete the necessary attachments required for FedRAMP submission.",

As a part of the FedRAMP journey, our team works with all relevant stakeholders to educate the team on new process requirements to ensure the CSP becomes compliant and remains compliant after authorization.

        "Description": "Based in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, Emagine IT (EIT) provides tailored cybersecurity and enterprise IT services to improve risk postures and deliver digital transformation to its commercial and federal customer. EIT specializes in delivering cost conscious, innovative solutions to meet the evolving business requirements of the clients we serve. As a Type C FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), EIT is authorized to conduct independent security risk assessments for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and deliver FedRAMP consulting services. EIT’s 3PAO services provide multiple levels of security assessment for CSP’s looking to comply with FedRAMP and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. While many CSP’s set out to and achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO), others simply want to be held to the highest standard. With over 1,000 federal assessments based on NIST controls, EIT is ready to support your needs. We offer Gap Assessments, FedRAMP Assessments, Readiness Assessments, Turn-key SSP Documentation and Consulting, Penetration Testing, and Threat Hunting.\n\n**FedRAMP Readiness Assessment / Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)**\n\nSome organizations may opt to pursue a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to help market their platform and attract an agency sponsor. This step toward your eventual FedRAMP authorization does not require a full penetration test, but you must still demonstrate a level of maturity aligned with the FedRAMP security framework. EIT can quickly support this FedRAMP stage with a four-week assessment timeline that may lead to your “FedRAMP Ready” designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.\n\n**FedRAMP Assessment & Attestation**\n\nAs a FedRAMP 3PAO, EIT has performed thousands of security assessments across the federal and commercial landscape. Because EIT has been on both sides of the process, we believe advisors make the best assessors. Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists. They understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. Working with EIT means you are mitigating risk and maintaining the agreed-upon timelines. Through the FedRAMP assessment process, EIT will develop the required documentation, including a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) to document assessment results, Security Assessment Report (SAR), and recommendation for authorization.\n\n**FedRAMP Advisory & Remediation**\n\nAre you transitioning to a new FIPS-199 designation, requiring you to comply with more controls? Are you thinking about implementing a multi-cloud deployment strategy? Are you trying to find ways to leverage your current compliance and security investments to help you achieve your FedRAMP authorization? Working collaboratively with your teams, we will identify, understand, and help you overcome your unique FedRAMP compliance challenges as we walk you through your FedRAMP preparation. With the gap assessment in-hand, EIT will work with your team to map out and engineer the ideal system architecture and to document the necessary environment and security practices within your custom-tailored System Security Plan (SSP). Our advisory services can encompass various CSP systems and service models to ensure that timelines are defined and met, deficiencies in system architecture and policies are mended, understanding of FedRAMP controls and procedures is achieved, annual audits and ATO renewal process is smooth with dedicated continuous monitoring.\n\n**Gap Assessment**\n\nThe first step in the certification process is to determine your organization’s readiness. How confident are you that you can move forward with your FedRAMP goals? Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your organization’s operations and security architecture. These discovery activities are led by EIT’s subject matter experts through hands-on workshops and interviews with key personnel in your organization, culminating in a final report that describes critical gaps and prescribes recommendations for remediation.\n\n**FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMonaaS)**\n\nMaintaining documentation and systems that are outmoded but still essential can command more resources than most organizations can sustain. FedRAMP is a continuous program, rather than just a project with a start and end date. The EIT team will establish and assist with the monthly, quarterly, and annual continuous monitoring activities and reports required to maintain your authority to operate. This offering can be integrated with your organization’s many compliance requirements, such as CMMC, FISMA, HITRUST, ISO, and more.",
