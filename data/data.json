ARC-P is a KVM based cloud system that assures interoperability and support for multiple hypervisor images. Agency virtualized images can be imported and exported from the ARC-P environment at agency request. ARC-P can support large numbers of agency virtual machines with the ability to scale services up and down according to agency customers? varying requirements. ARC-P IaaS offers additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk image library, raw (block) and file-based storage, customer virtual network (CVN) separation at layer 2, firewalls, load balancers, public facing IP addresses, and software bundles. ARC-P IaaS supplies elastic compute resources on-demand from ARC-P compute pools installed in our CONUS only data centers. For cloud environment connectivity, agencies can use available ARC-P VPN solutions over the Internet or dedicated carrier clouds and circuits.\n\n\n**ARC-P GPC** offers the same features as ARC-P GCC with additional logical and physical separation for private cloud environments that require a dedicated hardware stack.\n\n**ARC-P SDC** (Secure Data Center) service provides agencies and government contractors secure IT system colocation services to assist with federal data center consolidation mandates along with their cloud first requirements. ARC-P SDC allows government customers to collocate their non-virtualized and legacy IT systems, as well as IT systems and private cloud stacks in which an agency or government contractor wishes to develop, deploy, and manage the full IT stack within the ARC-P FedRAMP JAB authorized Security Authorization Boundary, with the ability to leverage and inherit those ARC-P security controls that apply specifically to the physical environment and physical security of our facilities. Autonomic Resources is responsible for the physical security and physical environmental controls associated with each provided private cage and provides space, power, and any needed network cross-connects to other environments or circuits provided by the customer, to their hosted virtual environments within the ARC-P IaaS Government Community Cloud or ARC-P Government Private Cloud stacks. Data Center facility providers can engage Autonomic Resources for accreditation of their space under ARC-P SDC.",

        "CSO_Description": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Helion for Public Sector is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud service that implements the complete FedRAMP Risk Management Framework by establishing controls for security, privacy, and IT governance to fulfill the NIST requirements for U.S. government agencies. This infrastructure and platform service offering is a highly secure, enterprise-class, cloud computing environment enabling government agencies, contractors and non-government organizations governed by federal regulations (e.g.: educational institutions, HIPAA-governed entities, and critical infrastructure ) to operate in the cloud with greater agility and flexibility while adhering to rigorous security, privacy, and IT governance controls required by the federal government.  HPE Helion for Public Sector consists of multiple components that can exist in a single cloud or operate within multiple clouds:   - Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): allows consumers to build and  manage Windows, Linux and/or UNIX services to host system middleware  or applications they install and manage themselves. The service  enables users to quickly provision both virtual and physical servers  in a consumption- based model. The service also allows clients to  co-locate customer-owned physical devices such as RISC chipset  servers or hardware security modules (MSM) in the same data center as  their cloud servers.   - Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS): enables consumers to  implement a disaster recovery capability to meet federal, state  and local requirements for contingency planning. This solution  automatically collects and maintains complete images of the   servers and network in their cloud, and can restore the entire cloud   without client intervention. This managed service also includes   assistance with disaster recovery planning and annual DR rehearsals.   Government agencies can benefit from HPE?s service excellence and   over 50 years of public sector experience, with a solution built from  the ground up with security and best practices in mind. The service   is hosted exclusively in auditable data centers in the continental   United States, and is staffed by U.S. persons.  HPE Helion for Public Sector complies with the following regulatory standards:   - FIPS 140-2 encryption (Federal Information Processing Standards 140-2  encryption)   - FedRAMP tailored CIS Level 1 configuration benchmarks (Center for  Internet Security Level 1)   - HIPAA/HITECH Security and Privacy (Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability Act/ Health Information Technology for  Economic and Clinical Health)   - ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations)  - FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)   - PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)  - CJIS (Criminal Justice Information System)  - FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)  - DIACAP/DIARMF (DoD Information Assurance   Certification and Accreditation Process/Defense Information   Assurance Risk Management Framework)   - DoD Cloud Security Reference Guide (SRG)   Information Impact level 2 (authorized 10/27/14)  For more information, visit our web site for the U.S. public sector at [www.hpe.com/gov/transformation](http://www.hpe.com/gov/transformation) or our worldwide web site at [www.hpe.com](http://www.hpe.com/).",

Its web interface offers fully secure email archiving with robust search and discovery, supervision, and enforcement features. The solution securely stores electronic messages for a specified retention period, while keeping the messages fully searchable and retrievable in real-time or with a batch process. This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user?s email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\n\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with *Proofpoint?s DoubleBlind? Encryption* technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.\n\n*Proofpoint?s DoubleBlind? Encryption* technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE?s web-based user interface. Data can never be viewed without access to both the archiving CPE within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment and the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment.",

In the private sector, consumers can shop, pay bills, and even conduct banking online, and now they?re expecting to conduct government business online in the same way. The most forward-thinking government IT managers are finding ways to meet expectations set by the private sector, and then going above and beyond to serve citizens.\r\n\r\nWith the Acquia Platform governments and agencies can use limited taxpayer dollars efficiently to build sites and experience that meet the needs of IT, deliver on the mission and give citizens crucial information they need.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit [Acquia.com/government](https://www.acquia.com/solutions/government) or contact us at 888.922.7842",

FedConnect is a Federal acquisition and grants portal where vendors and grant applicants can find opportunities for federal contracts, grants, and other types of assistance funding. It was developed to bridge the gap between government agencies and their vendor and grant applicant/recipient communities in order to streamline the process of doing business with government. Through the FedConnect portal Federal Government representatives are able to issue opportunity requests and make awards via the internet. Company representatives are able to review opportunities, submit bids or proposals, and receive awards. FedConnect provides an open channel of communication with the government that is both secure and auditable.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of government opportunities facilitated through FedConnect: traditional eRFX issuance, Reverse Auction events, and Financial Assistance opportunities, e.g. grants. For eRFX and Financial Assistance opportunities, FedConnect is offered by subscription fee to Federal Government agencies that are federally regulated. For Reverse Auction only, there is no subscription fee to Federal Government agencies. The bidding and winning vendor company is responsible for payment upon award.\r\n\r\nOn the government side, FedConnect is accessed through a system-to-system interface to the Compusearch Acquisition and Grants Management software application, PRISM.

ARC-P is a KVM based cloud system that assures interoperability and support for multiple hypervisor images. Agency virtualized images can be imported and exported from the ARC-P environment at agency request. ARC-P can support large numbers of agency virtual machines with the ability to scale services up and down according to agency customers? varying requirements. ARC-P IaaS offers additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk image library, raw (block) and file-based storage, customer virtual network (CVN) separation at layer 2, firewalls, load balancers, public facing IP addresses, and software bundles. ARC-P IaaS supplies elastic compute resources on-demand from ARC-P compute pools installed in our CONUS only data centers. For cloud environment connectivity, agencies can use available ARC-P VPN solutions over the Internet or dedicated carrier clouds and circuits.\n\n\n**ARC-P GPC** offers the same features as ARC-P GCC with additional logical and physical separation for private cloud environments that require a dedicated hardware stack.\n\n**ARC-P SDC** (Secure Data Center) service provides agencies and government contractors secure IT system colocation services to assist with federal data center consolidation mandates along with their cloud first requirements. ARC-P SDC allows government customers to collocate their non-virtualized and legacy IT systems, as well as IT systems and private cloud stacks in which an agency or government contractor wishes to develop, deploy, and manage the full IT stack within the ARC-P FedRAMP JAB authorized Security Authorization Boundary, with the ability to leverage and inherit those ARC-P security controls that apply specifically to the physical environment and physical security of our facilities. Autonomic Resources is responsible for the physical security and physical environmental controls associated with each provided private cage and provides space, power, and any needed network cross-connects to other environments or circuits provided by the customer, to their hosted virtual environments within the ARC-P IaaS Government Community Cloud or ARC-P Government Private Cloud stacks.

As organizations have embraced the cloud for email needs, the Email Threat Prevention Cloud provides complete email security for cloud mailboxes.\n\nOrganizations face an ever-increasing number of threats from email based spam, viruses, and advanced threats. Email-based attacks, in particular spear phishing, remain one of the primary methods used to initiate an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack because of the complexity involved in detecting them. To protect against malicious emails, organizations simply route messages to the Email Threat Prevention Cloud. The cloud analyzes the emails for spam and known viruses first. It then uses the signature-less FireEye Multi-vector Virtual Execution? (MVX) engine to analyze attachments and URLs to detect threats and stop APT attacks in real time.\n\n**Easy deployment and cross-enterprise protection**\n\nWithout hardware or software to install, the Email Threat Prevention Cloud is a particularly good fit for organizations seeking to move their infrastructure into the cloud. This eliminates the complexity of procuring, installing, and managing a physical infrastructure.\n\nEmail Threat Prevention Cloud integrates with the entire FireEye portfolio for real-time threat intelligence sharing. This rich correlation of threat intelligence provides organizations several unique capabilities, such as:\n\n - Identifying previous targets of spear-phishing emails \r\n - Locating copies of the malicious email in target inboxes \r\n - Finding out if the message is being forwarded to new targets\r\n - Highlighting URLs that become malicious after message delivery\n\nFor added accessibility and ease-of-use, the dashboard shows region- and industry-based malware trends, and audit logging.",

        "Description": "Veris Group provides FedRAMP 3PAO Assessment Support Services for any customer looking to have an external, independent third party assessment. Having performed the very first JAB, Agency, and CSP-Supplied (now defunct) assessments, we know what it takes to successful assess small and large CSPs against the FedRAMP requirements. Our testers are industry certified and internally trained with our structured process to ensure everyone conducts their tests in the same manner.  We are also well-versed in the FedRAMP Accelerated process, having conducted 2 of the first 3 through the program. The results of our Readiness Assessments for those CSPs helped shape the updated requirements for the Readiness Review process. Lastly, we successfully completed 2 of the first 3 FedRAMP High Baseline assessments. Our constant involvement in the FedRAMP program allows us to share internal lessons learned across our team to ensure everyone is up to date on the latest guidance and requirements.",
