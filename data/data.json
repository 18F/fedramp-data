        "CSO_Description": "The Federal Private Cloud (FPC) is a General Support System (GSS) platform (PaaS) built primarily on Microsoft Azure Government. Project Hosts also deploys customer dedicated subnets on Azure commercial for those customers/ agencies that request this. The GSS is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each Application deployed on the FPC. The Federal Private Cloud is classified as a hybrid cloud deployment model to enable state and local agencies as well as commercial entities to deploy applications in a secure environment on top of the FPC GSS system.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of customers who use the FPC: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multi tenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal, state or local agencies and commercial customers deploying dedicated applications just for their agency or organization. For both types of customer, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers or Azure PaaS services inside customer-dedicated subnets. Network security group access controls ensure that each customer’s subnet is completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer’s subnet. PaaS security subnets handling functions such as authentication, DMZ, SIEM, etc. are built on Azure Government.\r\n\r\nFor FPC customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the FPC FedRAMP package. Namely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with FPC architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\r\n\r\nFor ISV customers, Project Hosts also helps to create their SaaS-level FedRAMP package, helps them throughout the agency authorization process, and manages their 3PAO annual assessments.\r\n\r\nFor agency customers, Project Hosts assists them in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides a monthly application-level POA&M. Following is a partial list of applications for which Project Hosts is providing these services over and above the FPC platform:\n\n* Accenture Federal (Task management Tool)\r\n* Blue Prism (Blue Prism)\r\n* BrightWork (BrightWork SharePoint-based Project Management)\r\n* Checkmarx (CxSAST Source Code Scanner)\r\n* Drupal (Drupal CMS)\r\n* FlowVU (FlowVU Collaboration)\r\n* Gimmal (Gimmal Records Management)\r\n* Lexmark (Managed Print Service)\r\n* Microsoft (Office, Dynamics, Power BI Server, Project Server, SharePoint, SSRS)\r\n* Sopheon (Accolade Enterprise Innovation Management)\r\n* UMT360 (SharePoint-based Enterprise Portfolio Management)\r\n* Vendigital (Vendigital)\r\n* WordPress (WordPress CMS)\r\n* Permuta (Defense Ready)\r\n* ORDR (ORDR)\r\n* Nuance (Dragon Medical One)\r\n* Gimmal (Records Management)\r\n* Invoke (UiPath Orchestrator)\r\n* Conga (Contract Lifecycle Management and Conga Approvals)\r\n* Davra (WebEx Legislate)\n\nIf an agency would like to use one of these Applications or bring in another FPC-compatible Application, Project Hosts will provide application-level artifacts that will help the agency assess the risk of deploying that application in the FPC as well as any other documentation or evidence required in order to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO).",

        "CSO_Description": "The Qualtrics XM Platform is a web-based application that allows Government agencies to create surveys and then collect, analyze, and store the data produced from those surveys. Government agencies can use the application to collect and analyze citizen, employee, and community feedback to improve services and engagement for both external customers (citizens) and internal customers (public sector employees). The Qualtrics XM Platform enables multiple departments within an agency to collect and analyze survey data within a single enterprise system, allowing all levels of the agency or department to have access to important feedback data. The XM Platform includes an array of services that can be utilized to track, manage, and improve the experience of external and internal customers, such as:\r\n\r\n• XM Core – Allows agencies to construct surveys, distribute them to participants, and then manage and analyze individual participant responses. Agencies can then create reports that present the results and publish these reports to the web or share the report links with others.\r\n• Customer Experience - Allows agencies to study and improve the customer experience by employing Relationship NPS, Transactional NPS, Customer Satisfaction, and Event Feedback programs.\r\n• Employee Experience - Allows agencies to measure and manage employee engagement by creating feedback loops for relevant aspects of public sector employment, such as Manager Feedback, Training Feedback, Employee Engagement, and Employee Pulse programs.\r\n• Site Intercept – Allows agencies to display a piece of text, graphic, or widget that encourages a visitor to their website to take a survey or redirect to a specific webpage. To implement, the agency administrator places a snippet of Qualtrics’ JavaScript code on the agency’s website.\r\n• Actions and Tickets - Allows defining and triggering a workflow when a set of conditions are met, such as creating support tickets or integrating with external systems via web service API.\r\n• Data Analytics - Provides ability to perform natural language processing, statistical and predictive analysis of the data collected via the Research Suite.\r\n• Reports and Dashboards – Enables agencies to build dashboards that provide visual displays of the data collected from an agency’s surveys combined with other imported data sources.\r\n\r\nQualtrics creates a library where each agency can store question templates, graphics, messages, and files to be used in building surveys and sending messages to participants. Agencies can integrate data from other sources, such as their customer relationship management (CRM) tools, and produce and share reports. They can upload a list of contacts as a CSV file or manually enter or edit contacts. Agencies can also view the complete history of interactions that they have had with their contacts via emails or survey responses.\r\n\r\nThe XM Platform allows customers to send surveys, notifications, and other messages via a built-in email mechanism. To enable this, the application provides an outbound mail delivery engine via SMTP. In addition, customers can generate a URL that links to their survey and send the URL out to survey participants via their own email systems.\r\n\r\nReports and data can be exported to a variety of formats, including Word, Excel, PDF, and CSV/TSV, etc.\r\n\r\nThe XM Platform provides an Administration tool that allows designated agency admins to create groups and user permissions and assign them to authorized agency users. Permissions can be set up at the agency, division, or organization level. A single sign-on (SSO) capability enables agencies to implement identity federation via LDAP, SAML / Shibboleth, central authentication service (CAS), or OAuth 2.0. Qualtrics also makes available a REST API to allow agencies to automate functions such as connecting Qualtrics surveys with external systems such as a CRM like Salesforce.",

Vaulting away shared account passwords, application passwords, and secrets is just one of the best practices to secure privileged access. Managing the vaulted credentials, leveraging secure administrative access via a distributed local jump box, establishing VPN-less privileged session to remotely access targeted infrastructure, and implementing multi-factor authentication are at the root of reducing threats, intentional or not. Centrify PAS allows for all the above, as well as enables agencies to authenticate internal and outsourced IT users through Active Directory, LDAP, or other cloud identity stores. Agencies can use one or any combination of these identity stores or grant granular, federated privileged access to resources for partners and third-party vendors. Ultimately, Centrify PAS grants access from a Web UI or mobile app and covers an agency’s entire attack surface, both on-premises and in the cloud. Centrify PAS minimizes the attack surface, improves audit and compliance visibility, and reduces risk, complexity, and costs. Centrify PAS seamlessly integrates with Centrify’s other solutions, namely the Centrify Authentication Service (which helps verify who requests privileged access by leveraging enterprise directory identities rather than local accounts) and Centrify Privilege Elevation Service (which enables host-based enforcement of just enough, just-in-time privileged access best practices).",

Its web interface offers fully secure email archiving with robust search and discovery, supervision, and enforcement features. The solution securely stores electronic messages for a specified retention period, while keeping the messages fully searchable and retrievable in real-time or with a batch process. This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user’s email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with *Proofpoint’s DoubleBlind™ Encryption* technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.\n*Proofpoint’s DoubleBlind™ Encryption* technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE’s web-based user interface. Data can never be viewed without access to both the archiving CPE within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment and the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment.",

        "CSO_Description": "Zscaler Internet Access delivers your security stack as a service from the cloud, eliminating the cost and complexity of traditional secure web gateway approaches. By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.\n**The Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security**\nThe data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations.\nHowever, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today’s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances — and their associated costs — are out of control. Furthermore, it’s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.\n**Zscaler Internet Access**\nZscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp — all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect — a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office — they get identical protection.\nZscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL. You get full protection from web and Internet threats. And with a cloud platform that supports Cloud Sandboxing, Next-Generation Firewall, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Cloud Application Visibility and Control, you can start with the services you need today and activate others as your needs grow.\nAll these capabilities are delivered from the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, the world’s largest security cloud, which processes more than 30 billion requests a day. With over 100 patents, the Zscaler platform has been architected from the ground up as a truly distributed, multi-tenant cloud with enterprise performance and scale.",

All email addresses are encrypted and kept private. And KnowBe4 has been PCI compliant from day one. KnowBe4 courses are SCORM compliant, so we can deliver courseware for your in-house LMS if needed. However, KnowBe4 does have its own LMS that lives in the cloud, and we can report back to you about all enrolled employees, their status, completion, and many other parameters.",

        "CSO_Description": "**ZSCALER PRIVATE ACCESS**\n**The first major breakthrough in secure remote access since the VPN**\nZscaler is a leader in securing Internet traffic for enterprises around the globe, with a cloud-based security platform designed to protect enterprise Internet traffic with Secure Web Gateway, Cloud Application Visibility and Control, Cloud Sandboxing, Data Loss Prevention, and more. Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets.\nZscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience.\nWith Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service.\nZscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.\n**Improve your security posture even as you provide seamless access**\nThe reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.\n**Connect by application, not by IP address**\nVPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks.\nEliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment\nAs part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your “client sprawl” by delivering a\nsingle app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more.\nTake your applications from “on-net” to “dark- net,” at the same time YOU get complete visibility. Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unroutable to anyone. But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never before been possible. Once you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are actually running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected! And once you know what applications are running, you can easily create granular access rules for them.\nApp Discovery makes deployment easy.",

        "CSO_Description": "Ease the burden of retaining and producing text message communications and respond to the challenges of FOIA requests with the Federal Archive from Smarsh. Deployed in AWS GovCloud and built to meet federal security requirements, Federal Archive enables agencies to capture, archive, access and produce text message communications quickly and efficiently.\nSupported channels include AT&T and Verizon, with additional communication channels on the roadmap.\n\nRecords Managers, CTOs, CIOs and IT staff will appreciate secure, centralized, automated digital content combined with powerful search and retrieval capabilities in a single solution. Onboarding is simple, scalable and cost-effi­cient. Federal Archive has been designed to protect agencies now and in the future, providing peace of mind in a constantly evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nKey capabilities to manage government communications records include:\n\n* Direct, Contextual Capture: All content is captured directly from AT&T and Verizon via API connections. Messages are captured with full context and metadata, rather than being flattened to email format. Upon ingestion into the archive, content is easily accessible and ready to be leveraged for high speed search and export.\n* Powerful Search: Industry-leading search speeds are supported, regardless of the volume of ingested data. Search results are displayed with message threading and attachments to maintain the full context of each conversation.\n* High Speed Exports: Any/all messages and message metadata can be exported from the platform at high speed. Exports are password protected and export history logs can be displayed in the platform for reference or repeat downloads. Messages can also be exported from search results – either the full search list or a subset of selected messages.\n* External Archive Functionality: In addition to its integrated archive, Federal Archive provides clients with the option to capture content and send it directly to an external archive in EML or SFTP format.\n* Advanced Admin & Permissions: Within the platform, identities are unified across supported channels and are searchable by profile. Profiles can be filtered based on whether they are internal or external, by person or organization and/or by channel. Admins have a dashboard view of their organization’s archived channels as well as the provisioning status of each channel for enhanced oversight.\n* Federal Grade Security: Federal Archive will be deployed in AWS GovCloud. Built specifically for government agencies, GovCloud hosts sensitive data and regulated workflows with the most stringent security and compliance controls. Amazon’s physical and other security controls have been architected to meet the specific requirements of government agencies. The platform adheres to top-tier security standards, with all captured data encrypted in transit and at rest.\n\nFor more information, visit [https://www.smarsh.com/products/connected-archive/federal-archive/](https://www.smarsh.com/products/connected-archive/federal-archive/)",

        "CSO_Description": "Everlaw is a collaborative, cloud-based litigation platform for corporate counsels, litigators and government attorneys that enables teams to discover, reveal, and act on information to better drive internal investigations and positively impact the outcome of litigation, congressional hearings, internal and regulatory investigations.\n\nUnlike slow, unwieldy, client-server software and expensive third-party service providers, only Everlaw combines speed, security, and ease-of-use into a unified, comprehensive solution that unlocks the collaborative power of teams and enables them to investigate issues more thoroughly, uncover truth more quickly, and present their findings more clearly. \n\nThe Everlaw platform provides three primary capabilities, enabling federal agencies to: \n\n* Discover: Discover meaningful information by streamlining every step of the ediscovery process, from data upload and processing all the way through to search, review, and production.\n* Reveal: Leverage powerful analytics, machine learning, and interactive visualizations to accelerate review and identify the most valuable information.\n* Act: Collaborate to craft narratives, organize arguments logically, and manage the end-to-end process of investigations or litigation with a secure, integrated suite of post-review tools.\n\nKey product features include: \n\nData ingestion: Everlaw accelerates the document review process by enabling reviewers to upload their own documents, plugging in seamlessly with third-party cloud hosting platforms, and ingesting documents quickly. \n\nDocument Search: Everlaw's instantaneous search results occur with even the most complex search strings. The ability to visually build searches allows both novice and power users to narrow their searches without concern of the elusive missing parenthesis. \n\nDocument Review: Providing exceptionally fast 'doc-to-doc' review speeds and shortcuts like coding presets, users are able to complete their review significantly more quickly on Everlaw. \n\nProductions: Cloud-based production environment that can generate, modify and share legal document productions at any time. \n\nAdvanced analytics: Automatically translates, transcribes and converts hidden data, bringing to the surface the information that often remains hidden during document review. \n\nPredictive coding: Enables reviewers to use their standard workflow--assigning ratings, codes, and attributes to reviewed documents--in order to teach the system how to find more relevant documents on their behalf. \n\nData visualization: Interactive visualizations from any set of documents that provide key insights into document dates, metadata, contents, formats, review activity, and predicted relevance. \n\nSecure collaboration: Sharing and communication between opposing counsel, investigative teams, and subject matter experts directly in the platform to promote secure, seamless collaboration. \n\nNarrative building: Story-building to collaboratively align investigative teams, improve workflow, reduce risk, and save time by organizing key documents into a compelling narrative. \n\nDepositions: Integrated deposition tracking tools enable significant cost reductions and time savings by eliminating the need to print out physical copies of all exhibits, pass handwritten notes, and later transfer key information into an online repository.

As the first comprehensive, fully functional system designed expressly for government agencies to manage employee relocation, that trust is well founded. Agencies can be confident that every relocation processed using moveLINQ will be in full compliance. The software automates FTR, JTR, DSSR, and 6FAM CONUS/OCONUS relocation policy, and adheres to E-Gov Travel, GSA/OMB reporting, and Section 508 standards.\nNow mLINQS offers its leading relocation management on a hosted platform. As with other hosted solutions, this Software as a Service (SaaS) model provides agencies higher availability at a lower cost. Federal managers are able to focus their budgets on business objectives rather than infrastructure and the need to predict and meet future capacity. By leveraging efficiencies attained by hosting multiple federal agencies, mLINQS Hosting Services provides increased scalability and flexibility while increasing support services to customers.",

        "CSO_Description": "FedConnect® provides US Government Acquisition leaders and Contract Officers a secure, full-lifecycle, auditable approach to interacting with vendors and complying with Paperless Contracting mandates. FedConnect is a Federal acquisition and grants portal where vendors and grant applicants can find opportunities for federal contracts, grants, and other types of assistance funding. It was developed to bridge the gap between government agencies and their vendor and grant applicant/recipient communities in order to streamline the process of doing business with government. Through the FedConnect portal, Federal Government representatives are able to issue opportunity requests and make awards via the internet. Company representatives are able to review opportunities, submit bids or proposals, and receive awards. FedConnect provides an open channel of communication with the government that is both secure and auditable.\nThere are three types of government opportunities facilitated through FedConnect: traditional eRFX issuance, Reverse Auction events, and Financial Assistance opportunities, e.g. grants. For eRFX and Financial Assistance opportunities, FedConnect is offered by subscription fee to Federal Government agencies that are federally regulated. For Reverse Auction only, there is no subscription fee to Federal Government agencies. The bidding and winning vendor company is responsible for payment upon award.\nOn the government side, FedConnect is accessed through a system-to-system interface to the Unison Contracting and Grants software applications, where Government procurement and grant representatives become indirect users of FedConnect.\nOn the Vendor/Applicant side, FedConnect is accessed via the internet with a browser. Anyone can access the FedConnect web site and review public opportunities. However, to receive directed opportunities that are not publicly issued, respond electronically, and receive ongoing communications, a vendor/applicant must be registered.\nTo learn more about FedConnect and its capabilities, please visit the public portion of the FedConnect site.",

        "CSO_Description": "**Service Description**\nThe Exterro Platform is a single, natively built, fully integrated solution that unifies all of Exterro's E-Discovery and Information Governance products. Further, it includes our integration hub, which connects to the industry's broadest range of 3rd party tools, system applications, and data sources, orchestrating processes across applications and minimizing your cost of ownership.\nProducts within The Exterro Platform:\n**Employee Change Monitor**\nEmployee Change Monitor enables you to proactively take steps to mitigate risk associated with the change in any data field stored in your HR information system and shared with the Exterro Platform. For example, when an employee leaves your organization, a task can be issued to take a snapshot of her email box and backup her files, a system notification can be sent to alert Records Management of the change in employment status, and the employee can automatically be released from any active legal holds.\n**File Analysis**\nExterro File Analysis provides the critical foundation for any Information Governance project by delivering the information you need to achieve your cost and risk reduction efforts. Intuitive and data-rich dashboards in Exterro's File Analysis software display key information about the content stored on your data sources such as network shares and SharePoint servers. Key document properties such as date created, last modified, access rights, metadata, and content type are displayed, providing the critical foundation for all your information governance cost and risk reduction activities. Proactively manage policies that support organizational goals by gaining insight into the content that matters most. Easily identify data that has business or legal value, such as sensitive data (e.g. personally identifiable or health information), files found outside retention guidelines or ESI on legal hold, to make informed business decisions.\n**Data Mapping**\nBuild and maintain an up-to-date directory that mirrors your evolving data source inventory with Exterro Data Mapping. Identify important ESI repositories, eliminate irrelevant ones, and meet the most rigorous judicial and compliance standards.\n**Legal Hold**\nSay goodbye to manual, time consuming, and error-prone litigation hold processes with world-class legal hold software. With Exterro Legal Hold, you can:\n* Manage the entire legal hold process - from notifications, to interviews, to reminders, and more - in one place\n* Protect and secure data from accidental deletion with the In-Place Preservation module\n* Integrate with your HR system, and get notified of employee status changes, to mitigate the risk of spoliation and automate other operational processes with the Employee Change Monitor module\n* Quickly identify critical information from custodian data stored in Microsoft Office 365 prior to collection with the Office 365 Explorer module\n**In-Place Early Case Assessment**\nPerform early case assessment through a broad set of analytic and predictive intelligence capabilities that enable rapid identification of the most important documents in a dataset prior to collection. Uncover crucial documents and communications prior to 26(f) conferences to support your proportionality and strategic arguments.\n**Collection and Processing**\nPerform targeted collections and full e-discovery document review with a “one-click” ability to collect only the relevant files that are identified during ECA. Exterro supports the ability to connect to an ever growing list of 30+ on premises and cloud-based data sources, eliminating the need to send requests to multiple stakeholders to perform collections. Exterro is unique in the market by combining processing with collection and offering documents for review almost immediately after the collection process is started, thus saving you time and money while reducing risk associated with manual handoffs and promotions. In addition, our underlying technology has been built with the future in mind, able to easily and quickly process vast amounts of data without impacting performance for your users.\n**ESI Vault**\nThe most architecturally advanced ESI storage available delivers significant cost savings, risk reduction, and powers productivity through cross-matter work product re-use and analytics. Maximize work product re-use via a real-time, fully integrated ESI vault that enables one-click repurposing of data across matters. Gain insight and optimize operations through cross matter analytics.\n**Review**\nExterro’s end-to-end, fully integrated platform ensures the shortest possible time to review from matter inception. Documents can be concurrently collected and processed from multiple data sources and seamlessly moved into review as data becomes available, without delays, handoffs, and complex promotion/staging procedures common in other platforms.\n**Production**\nChoose between Native, PDF, and TIFF production outputs depending on the requirements of your matter. Exterro supports industry-standard loadfiles, including Concordance®, Summation®, EDRM XML, and even custom loadfile. Exterro Production automates the entire production process, including imaging, branding, redaction application and loadfile creation into a single step, eliminating technical intervention and time-consuming handoffs. **Legal Project Management**\nExterro Project Management is the only purpose-built project management system designed specifically to orchestrate the workflows and activities associated with e-discovery and other legal processes. Easily modified user-defined workflows coordinate all relevant tasks and activities, including preservation, collection, processing, review, and production.",

        "CSO_Description": "**Overview**\n\nCofense PhishMe™ is a cloud-based software solution that enables organizations to improve employee resiliency to phishing attacks by providing a turnkey platform for running simulated real-life phishing scenarios.\n\nCofense PhishMe has the largest installed base of Federal government users of any solution in the simulation and awareness training category. More than 2000 of world’s largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on Cofense PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks.\n\nOnce certified, Cofense PhishMe will achieve FedRAMP Moderate Authorization, an important milestone meeting the security baselines for more than 300 controls.  According to FedRAMP, Moderate Impact Authorization “is most appropriate for CSOs where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effects on an agency’s operations, assets, or individuals […] including significant operational damage to agency assets, financial loss, or individual harm that is not loss of life or physical.”  For comparison, solutions achieving FedRAMP Low Authorization are only required to address 125 controls, while organizations obtaining the FedRAMP LI-SaaS Authorization are responsible for just 38 controls.\n\n**More about Cofense PhishMe**\n\nThe system enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails.\n \nFor example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their banking credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, Cofense PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that actual phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future.\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:\n\n* PhishMe content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.\n* Responsive Delivery: Cofense PhishMe allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. \n* Playbooks: Cofense PhishMe includes predefined Playbooks, with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices.\n\nCofense PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks—the leading cause of data breaches—through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.",

Customers can engage resources in an a la carte, and “pay for performance” model that allows them to know exactly what to expect – It’s the technology you need, when you need it.\nAll infrastructure resources are managed and monitored through the KPS tool “Zeus”, which is included within the boundaries of the CloudSeed system, and gives customers the ability to view and manage cloud resources across the full range of possible KPS cloud deployments – Public, Federal Community, and Private - as well as across multiple CSPs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and on-premise virtualization technologies (ESXi, KVM, etc.). By providing customers this single pane of glass to both view and manage all of their infrastructure solutions, Zeus allows for true “hybrid” cloud solutions that can combine pre-existing customer solutions with new cloud-based solutions. Zeus gives customers a truly \"holistic\" view into their infrastructure, and allows them to move workloads across solutions as-needed to address specific business requirements.\nThe technical architecture that makes up CloudSeed is also available via the KPS Public Cloud for both Federal and Commercial customers, as well as in private cloud deployments on a customer's premises or in KPS' FedRAMP compliant data center. This architecture providers cheap, efficient, and reliable clouds by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and automatically and instantly recognizing every piece of hardware that is plugged into the system as simply Compute, Storage, or Network resources. In other words, KPS customers are able to use their pre-existing equipment as the basis for their own private cloud deployment simply by connecting it to the system via ethernet or fiber cable. Through this technology, customers are able to instantiate an entire cloud from scratch in under 20 minutes while re-using many of the same technical controls implemented in Knight Point's Federal Cloud, giving them previously unparalleled flexibility in their cloud deployments.",

Our platform enables agencies to foster greater digital engagement with citizens and securely deliver mission essential information and services with greater speed, agility, and resiliency.\nThe City of LA, State of New York, FEMA, Department of Homeland Security and many other government agencies rely on the Acquia platform to build websites and digital experiences that meet the needs of their citizens, internal users and IT teams while moving their missions forward.\nThese agencies know that a citizen-centric government requires more than simply taking the existing physical structure and making it digital. Today the term “digital” has taken on a new meaning. In the private sector, consumers can shop, pay bills, and even conduct banking online, and now they’re expecting to conduct government business online in the same way. The most forward-thinking government IT managers are finding ways to meet expectations set by the private sector, and then going above and beyond to serve citizens.\nWith the Acquia Platform governments and agencies can use limited taxpayer dollars efficiently to build sites and experience that meet the needs of IT, deliver on the mission and give citizens crucial information they need.",

        "CSO_Description": "Discovering data is only the tip of the iceberg. What really matters is the intelligence you gain from the data you retain. Modus provides a full suite of eDiscovery services to help government agencies plan, discover, interpret, manage and leverage raw data into Discovery Intelligence to help optimize their legal enterprise. Modus eDiscovery services span the entire EDRM, providing government agencies with hands-on expertise in all areas vital to their businesses.\n* eDiscovery Reporting\n* Data Collection and Forensics\n* eDiscovery Processing\n* Early Case Assessment\n* Hosting Options\n* eDiscovery Production\nModus is partners with Venio Systems and can offer our clients the VenioOne unified eDiscovery software platform. Venio One offers a powerful and scalable solution providing users the ability to process, analyze, review and produce with increased efficiency.\nVenioOne allows us to bring all phases of eDiscovery—from processing through production—under one platform. We can make the workflow as streamlined and productive as possible while leveraging VenioOne’s complete unified system, user-friendly interface and its fast and powerful data processing engine.\n**Data Governance**\nModus has the resources and technologies to provide a single-source data management service bringing order to data chaos. We know the individual components of data management aren’t used in isolation, so we take a holistic approach to managing your data. Modus solutions keep your data secure, healthy, and agile – exposing reliable data sets that empower you to make intelligent business decisions.\n**Artifical Intelligence (AI) in eDiscovery**\nModus is partnering with the most powerful AI providers in the industry to enable these powerful analytics tools for the eDiscovery environment. Government Agencies interested in this technology can utilize their relationship with Modus to pursue these powerful tools in your eDiscovery objectives.\n**Discovery Production**\nAs electronically stored information has become more diverse and voluminous, the specificity and complexity of production formats has similarly increased. Today, productions may be required in a variety of formats, including native, PDF, and TIFF, with or without intricate load files, extracted text, and other features. Conforming, precisely and consistently, to mandated production specifications is an essential component of eDiscovery success.\nModus’ production services include:\n* Native Production\n* PDF Production\n* TIFF Production\n* Hybrid Production\n* Custom Load File Creation\n* Slipsheet/Placeholder Generation\n* Endorsements and Bates Numbering\n**Data Collection and Forensics**\nThe collection of potentially relevant materials – whether physically or electronically stored – is a critical early step in the eDiscovery process. Successful execution of a collection requires the maintenance of both forensic soundness and the chain of custody from source to production, as well as the tools and experience to collect from today’s ever-multiplying range of sources. Modus’ collection services include: * Evidence Identification\n* Data Harvesting & Forensic Collection\n* Forensic Imaging\n* Live & Targeted Data Acquisitions\n* Preservation\n* Analysis\n**eDiscovery Processing**\nTo facilitate hosted review and production, all collected electronically stored information must be processed. Such materials can come in hundreds of different formats, with different properties, different metadata, and potentially, different nested content. Processing finds and expands nested content, captures and organizes metadata, and extracts and normalizes text for review and production. Modus processing services enable you to use our hosted review platform or your own. We’ve built processing templates for all of the leading ECA and review tools to ensure you get pristine loads and fast, accurate and consistent processing no matter which downstream tools you are using. And, we can quickly customize or build a new template to meet your requirements. Processing Types Including:\n* Native File\n* Full TIFF\n* Email\n* Others\nProcessing Services:\n* Analytical Reporting\n* File Type Analysis\n* De-NISTing\n* Date Filtering\n* File Type/Categorized Filtering/ StellentID\n* Standard and Search-Based Processing\n* Metadata Extraction\n* De-Duplication (Custodial or Global)\n* Near-Duplicate Identification and Handling\n* Email Threading\n* Foreign Language Identification (with Percentages and Rankings)",

The products together authenticate the physical and digital information protecting the\r\nauthenticity and integrity of the document, provide an assessment of the degree of match of the\r\nindividual to the photo(s) stored on the document, and perform presentation attack detection via\r\nliveness assessment of the individual performing the transaction.\n\n* AssureID™ Connect SaaS authenticates the physical security features of the document\n* Ozone® eMRTD Authentication SaaS ensures the electronic data is cryptographically intact and\r\ndigitally bound to a trusted issuing authority\r\n* Once the document has been determined to be authentic and unmodified from its initial\r\nissuance, Acuant FaceID Government SaaS performs a facial recognition match of the photo(s)\r\nfrom the document with the individual presenting the document\n* Acuant Passive Liveness SaaS performs presentation attack detection to thwart fraud\n\nDocument authentication is vital part of confirming the identity of an individual. Authenticating a\r\ndocument requires reviewing the physical document for the presence of known security features;\r\nfeatures which are specific to each document type and series from a given issuer. The security features\r\nthat are found on the presented document then need to be compared against the expected/known\r\nsecurity features for the specific document and its issuer. Additionally, with the advent of electronic\r\nidentity documents, the electronic data stored on the document must be authenticated and validated\r\nusing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components to cryptographically assess the data encoded in the\r\nchip of the document and their binding to the Issuer. Finally, to ensure the document belongs to the\r\nindividual presenting the document, a biometric match comparing the image from the document to the\r\nindividual should be made, and the liveness of the individual must be determined – especially in remote\r\nvetting situations.",

Solution features include:\n\n**Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)**\n\r\n* Routing services based on Cisco’s Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) technology.\r\n* **ACD functionality** which allows collection and routing of calls to a contact center agent; conversion of calls to formats that can be carried by a data network to their recipient; rules-based routing; multi-skilled expert agent selection; precision routing; supervisor features; call prompting; announcements; and music-on-hold and queuing capabilities.\r\n* **Precision routing**, which sends the contact to the best available resource based on information about the caller and the attributes of the agent. By delivering the contact effectively, companies can reduce overall handling time, decrease the need for multiple transfers, and increase customer satisfaction with the experience. Precision routing is supported for all contact channels, including voice, video, web, chat, and email.\r\n* **Computer Telephony Integration (CTI):** Screen pops based on ANI or customer-entered information can be used to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.\r\n* **Queue enhancements:** includes priority within queue, announcements/prompts within the queue, redirect on no answer.\n\n**Agent and supervisor desktop**\n\r\nIncluded with Webex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government is the Cisco Finesse ® desktop, a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop designed to provide easy access to the applications and information your customer service organization needs through a customizable web-based interface.

These features add value to the supervisor’s role in the contact center and help them effectively manage their teams. These capabilities include:\r\n\r\n* **chat capabilities for supervisors and agents.** Supervisors can send chat messages to agents participating in a call, allowing supervisors to coach agents unobtrusively on cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and help agents resolve customer situations. Supervisors can interrupt an agent’s call to create a three-way conference, and then interact with both the caller and the agent to help resolve a concern. A supervisor can remove the agent from a call using the Intercept feature, allowing the supervisor and caller to complete the call on their own while the agent handles another customer request.\r\n* **Change an agent’s state from Supervisor desktop.** Agents may forget to make themselves available to take calls after a break or neglect to log out when away from their workstations for an extended period. Supervisors can easily log out missing agents or make unintentionally idle agents ready to take calls.\r\n* **Change an agent’s skill profile in real time.** This capability gives supervisors tactical tools to manage their agent teams and support contact center management objectives.\r\n\n**Administration and management portal**\r\nStreamlined administration allows managers to perform all contact center administration centrally. The administrative interface allows agents to be set up to handle voice, web, chat, and email contacts, depending on their assigned skill sets.\r\nThe interface allows system managers, administrators, and supervisors to develop, modify, or view routing scripts; manage the system configuration; monitor contact center performance; define and request reports; and help ensure system security. This one user interface provides enterprise-wide control across a single or multisite contact center.\r\n\nWebex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government web-based administration portal includes capabilities to:\r\n* Manage access and role-based permissions\r\n* Search for an agent team or skill group\r\n* Quickly add or remove agents to or from a skill or team\r\n* Create agents, change agent passwords, and disable agents\r\n* Bulk and clone agents\r\n* Create contact center users\r\n* Audit trail retention for six months\r\n* Administer Unified Communications (UC) phones and features\r\n* Customizable dashboards\r\n* Enable access to most functions via a mobile device (i.e., a smartphone or tablet if the device is connected to the customer’s network)\r\n* Create and publish audio files in real time\r\n* Automate distribution of audio files to media servers\r\n* Enable/disable pre-recorded audio prompts\r\n* Access restrictions\r\n\n**Self-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR)**\r\nProvided with the solution is a self-service interactive voice response via Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (Unified CVP). With Unified CVP, you can pay a bill, order products and track delivery, locate a dealer, schedule a pickup, change name and address information, make travel arrangements, check payment status, receive notification of unusual activity, and request literature or product information. Customers can use voice commands to retrieve the information they require without ever speaking with an agent, or to quickly navigate to the correct department or agent who can help them.

They are improving their DevSecOps processes, facilitating Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and shipping more code safer than ever. LaunchDarkly enables: \r\n\r\n* Resolution of incidents in less than 200 milliseconds, without costly rollbacks that threaten other features.\r\n* Powerful targeting capabilities that provide complete control over which users or microservices can see new features.\r\n* Safe testing in production—empowering teams with real-world QA testing in place of costly pre-production environments.\r\n* CI/CD development processes that improve developer productivity and new feature release times.\r\n* Hypothesis driven development, including A/B/n experimentation and percentage rollouts.\r\n\r\nLaunchDarkly provides developers and business stakeholders with a central location to manage the rollout of new features. At the same time, it can enforce change management policies through scheduling, approval workflows, and custom role-based access control down to the feature level. Agencies can implement their own policies around the use of personally identifiable information (PII) and can take full advantage of targeting without needing to store user PII within the LaunchDarkly Federal SaaS environment. Additional hosting options and an offline mode are available for organizations with more restrictive policies. \r\n",

The CMTS design is neither static nor monolithic.  Intentionally flexible, CMTS provides government agencies with the ability to establish unique naming conventions, tailor agency-specific workflows, and to support a wide range of other user-preferred configurations.  An idle-case tracking function also includes both time and activity-based notifications in order to establish and maintain a seamless agency workflow. \n\nAs an added layer of security, each CMTS customer operates in a secure environment with data separated by customer.  Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), CMTS is a web-based, browser-accessible application that requires no device-specific software for implementation.   \n\nHighly customizable dashboards, combined with specialized labels and entry fields provide investigators with the ability to compile and display comprehensive case metrics in a simplified, user-friendly format.  CMTS can display ad-hoc and pre-defined reports in minutes, drastically reducing processing times and increasing staff efficiency. This flexible design allows agencies to tailor workflows in order to match existing processes and to provide for continuity in ongoing investigations.  As a result, CMTS may be readily adapted to serve investigative offices of any size.\n\nMany of the CMTS customers leverage our optional Online Intake Service (OIS) which allows customers to host or leverage OIS hosted internet facing forms which can collect case intakes to be later securely picked up by the agency CMTS server for potential ingestion as a case.",
