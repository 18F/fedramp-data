Our platform enables agencies to foster greater digital engagement with citizens and securely deliver mission essential information and services with greater speed, agility, and resiliency.\nThe City of LA, State of New York, FEMA, Department of Homeland Security and many other government agencies rely on the Acquia platform to build websites and digital experiences that meet the needs of their citizens, internal users and IT teams while moving their missions forward.\nThese agencies know that a citizen-centric government requires more than simply taking the existing physical structure and making it digital. Today the term “digital” has taken on a new meaning. In the private sector, consumers can shop, pay bills, and even conduct banking online, and now they’re expecting to conduct government business online in the same way. The most forward-thinking government IT managers are finding ways to meet expectations set by the private sector, and then going above and beyond to serve citizens.\nWith the Acquia Platform governments and agencies can use limited taxpayer dollars efficiently to build sites and experience that meet the needs of IT, deliver on the mission and give citizens crucial information they need.",

Armis discovers every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in any environment, analyzes device behavior to identify risks, vulnerabilities or attacks, and protects critical business information and systems. Armis easily integrates with existing security products.\rAFE passively monitors wired and wireless traffic in the environment to identify every device and to understand its behavior without disruption. AFE analyzes this data in the AFE Risk Engine which uses device profiles and characteristics from the AFE Device Knowledgebase to identify each device, assess its risks & vulnerabilities, detect threats, and recommend remediation actions.\r**Visibility**\rAFE closes the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Dashboard visibility gap with unmanaged and IoT devices. AFE discovers and classifies every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in the environment including servers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP phones, smart TVs, IP cameras, printers, 5G, HVAC controls, medical devices, industrial controls, and more. AFE can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other protocols in any environment. The comprehensive device inventory that AFE generates includes critical information such as device manufacturer, model, serial number, location, username, operating system, installed applications, and connections made over time. In addition to discovering and classifying a device, AFE calculates its risk score based on factors such as vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, as well as the behaviors observed of each device in the environment. This risk score helps security teams understand their attack surface and meet compliance with regulatory frameworks that require identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities.\r**Insights**\nThe AFE Risk Engine continuously monitors the behavior of every device in the environment for behavioral anomalies. Working with the AFE Device Knowledgebase, AFE compares the real-time behavior of each device with:\r* Historical device behavior\r* Behavior of similar devices in the Customer's environment\r* Behavior of similar devices in other environments\r* Common attack techniques\r* Information from threat intelligence feeds\r**Actions**\rWith these types of critical device and behavioral insights, AFE is able to identify threats and attacks.\rWhen AFE detects a threat, it can alert security teams and trigger automated action to stop an attack. Through integrations with network infrastructure, as well as the Customer's existing security enforcement points like Cisco and Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and network access control (NAC) products such as Cisco ISE and Aruba ClearPass, AFE can restrict access or quarantine suspicious or malicious devices.\r**Easy Integration**\nAFE requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy. AFE integrates with existing firewalls or NAC, security management systems such as SIEM, ticketing systems, and asset databases. These integrations allow AFE to leverage existing investments to achieve greater value and more automated response.",

The primary use of AuthentX in the Federal government is to satisfy Homeland Security Presidential Directive #12 (HSPD-12), Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management (FICAM) and related policies, mandates and standards from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (SP). Therefore, the AuthentX Cloud solution offered is aligned with federal mandates and high assurance requirements regarding cybersecurity, multi-factor authentication, Federal interoperability, and secure solutions for consolidation of data centers. The AuthentX Cloud consists of COTS hardware, software, and network components assembled and connected in multiple data centers. Hardware includes the XTec AuthentX XaNode appliances, the XTec AuthentX Secure Appliance (ASA), enrollment and issuance peripherals, the XTec XNode and XTec card readers, and Thales SafeNet Hardware Security Modules (HSM’s). The software of the AuthentX system is built entirely from source to produce the AuthentX Linux Operating System (OS), customized embedded Microsoft OS, the AuthentX Enrollment Manager application, as well as other software packages.\n\n \n\nXTec’s AuthentX Cloud also provides Hardware Security Module (HSM) as a Service using Thales Trusted Cyber Technologies’ (TCT) flagship Luna T-Series HSM.  This cloud-based HSM, known as Luna as a Service, allows customers to generate, store, protect and manage cryptographic keys used to secure sensitive data and critical applications.  The Luna T-Series HSM at the core of Luna as a Service is FIPS 140-2, Level 3 certified, and is approved for use in National Security Systems PKI.  XTec’s AuthentX Cloud Luna as a Service is offered using three (3) models:\n\n* 1. Luna as a Service Dedicated HSM provides customers full cryptographic control of the entire HSM.\n* 2. Luna as a Service Managed HSM provides customers HSM cryptographic capabilities in a scalable, cost-effective model.  Administrative tasks such as provisioning, configuring, monitoring, and patching are all performed by U.S.-based Luna as a Service engineers.\n* 3. Luna as a Service Credential System provides customers a cloud service model of Thales TCT’s Luna Credential System (LCS).  LCS offers multi-factor authentication by maintaining user credentials in a centralized hardware device that is securely accessible through the cloud service by endpoints in a distributed network.  LCS is a multi-purpose, secure credential system ideally suited for an environment in which the endpoints, or users cannot use a traditional authentication token.",

WingSwept converted its Case Management & Tracking System (CMTS) into a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) service offering in 2010.\nBuilt with both security and flexibility in mind, CMTS provides for the secure storage, retrieval, and reporting of case management data for investigative offices at all levels of government. The CMTS design is neither static nor monolithic. Intentionally flexible, CMTS provides government agencies with the ability to establish unique naming conventions, tailor agency-specific workflows, and to support a wide range of other user-preferred configurations. An idle-case tracking function also includes both time and activity-based notifications in order to establish and maintain a seamless agency workflow. As an added layer of security, each CMTS customer operates in a secure environment with data separated by customer. Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), CMTS is a web-based, browser-accessible application that requires no device-specific software for implementation. Highly customizable dashboards, combined with specialized labels and entry fields provide investigators with the ability to compile and display comprehensive case metrics in a simplified, user-friendly format. CMTS can display ad-hoc and pre-defined reports in minutes, drastically reducing processing times and increasing staff efficiency. This flexible design allows agencies to tailor workflows in order to match existing processes and to provide for continuity in ongoing investigations. As a result, CMTS may be readily adapted to serve investigative offices of any size.\nMany of the CMTS customers leverage our optional Online Intake Service (OIS) which allows customers to host or leverage OIS hosted internet facing forms which can collect case intakes to be later securely picked up by the agency CMTS server for potential ingestion as a case.",

        "CSO_Description": "The KPS Federal Community Cloud, called CloudSeed®, is an off-premises IaaS solution that is FedRAMP compliant and meets DoD PA SRG Level 5 controls while leveraging Cisco hardware, world-class Equinix facilities, and open-source technology to provide compute, storage, and network resources to Federal customers in a secure manner. Customers can engage resources in an a la carte, and “pay for performance” model that allows them to know exactly what to expect – It’s the technology you need, when you need it.\nAll infrastructure resources are managed and monitored through the KPS tool “Zeus”, which is included within the boundaries of the CloudSeed system, and gives customers the ability to view and manage cloud resources across the full range of possible KPS cloud deployments – Public, Federal Community, and Private - as well as across multiple CSPs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and on-premise virtualization technologies (ESXi, KVM, etc.). By providing customers this single pane of glass to both view and manage all of their infrastructure solutions, Zeus allows for true “hybrid” cloud solutions that can combine pre-existing customer solutions with new cloud-based solutions. Zeus gives customers a truly \"holistic\" view into their infrastructure, and allows them to move workloads across solutions as-needed to address specific business requirements.\nThe technical architecture that makes up CloudSeed is also available via the KPS Public Cloud for both Federal and Commercial customers, as well as in private cloud deployments on a customer's premises or in KPS' FedRAMP compliant data center. This architecture providers cheap, efficient, and reliable clouds by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and automatically and instantly recognizing every piece of hardware that is plugged into the system as simply Compute, Storage, or Network resources. In other words, KPS customers are able to use their pre-existing equipment as the basis for their own private cloud deployment simply by connecting it to the system via ethernet or fiber cable. Through this technology, customers are able to instantiate an entire cloud from scratch in under 20 minutes while re-using many of the same technical controls implemented in Knight Point's Federal Cloud, giving them previously unparalleled flexibility in their cloud deployments.",

        "CSO_Description": "**Overview**\nCofense PhishMe™ is a cloud-based software solution that enables organizations to improve employee resiliency to phishing attacks by providing a turnkey platform for running simulated real-life phishing scenarios.\nCofense PhishMe has the largest installed base of Federal government users of any solution in the simulation and awareness training category. More than 2000 of world’s largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on Cofense PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks.\nOnce certified, Cofense PhishMe will achieve FedRAMP Moderate Authorization, an important milestone meeting the security baselines for more than 300 controls. According to FedRAMP, Moderate Impact Authorization “is most appropriate for CSOs where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effects on an agency’s operations, assets, or individuals […] including significant operational damage to agency assets, financial loss, or individual harm that is not loss of life or physical.” For comparison, solutions achieving FedRAMP Low Authorization are only required to address 125 controls, while organizations obtaining the FedRAMP LI-SaaS Authorization are responsible for just 38 controls.\n**More about Cofense PhishMe**\nThe system enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails.\nFor example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their banking credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, Cofense PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that actual phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future.\nTo maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:\n* PhishMe content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.\n* Responsive Delivery: Cofense PhishMe allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. * Playbooks: Cofense PhishMe includes predefined Playbooks, with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices.\nCofense PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks—the leading cause of data breaches—through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.",

Authenticating a\rdocument requires reviewing the physical document for the presence of known security features;\rfeatures which are specific to each document type and series from a given issuer. The security features\rthat are found on the presented document then need to be compared against the expected/known\rsecurity features for the specific document and its issuer. Additionally, with the advent of electronic\ridentity documents, the electronic data stored on the document must be authenticated and validated\rusing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components to cryptographically assess the data encoded in the\rchip of the document and their binding to the Issuer. Finally, to ensure the document belongs to the\rindividual presenting the document, a biometric match comparing the image from the document to the\rindividual should be made, and the liveness of the individual must be determined – especially in remote\rvetting situations.",

Secure and flexible SaaS management console allows for centralized policy-based and role-based management to ensure automated, robust and differentiated application of policies based on the user’s role. Automatic elevation of known good programs requiring elevation, including those legacy and not-UAC-aware, significantly cuts down on the IT Service Desk requests, while optional automatic access restriction (for example, network connectivity restriction) for unknown applications significantly reduces the area of attack and helps break ransomware kill chain. Out-of-the-box anti-ransomware policy allows to add additional layer of security around sensitive data and prevent data corruption even in the event of successful asset compromise and ransomware execution. Another critical capability is blocking credential, key, secret, password, hash, cookie and other sensitive information from memory, browsers, operating system and credential stores, effectively blocking most attacks based on credential compromise. Endpoint Privilege Manager helps with audit and compliance by addressing specific regulation requirements and creating audit trail for identity and privilege events on the endpoints.",

        "CSO_Description": "FedConnect® provides US Government Acquisition leaders and Contract Officers a secure, full-lifecycle, auditable approach to interacting with vendors and complying with Paperless Contracting mandates. FedConnect is a Federal acquisition and grants portal where vendors and grant applicants can find opportunities for federal contracts, grants, and other types of assistance funding. It was developed to bridge the gap between government agencies and their vendor and grant applicant/recipient communities in order to streamline the process of doing business with government. Through the FedConnect portal, Federal Government representatives are able to issue opportunity requests and make awards via the internet. Company representatives are able to review opportunities, submit bids or proposals, and receive awards. FedConnect provides an open channel of communication with the government that is both secure and auditable.\nThere are three types of government opportunities facilitated through FedConnect: traditional eRFX issuance, Reverse Auction events, and Financial Assistance opportunities, e.g. grants. For eRFX and Financial Assistance opportunities, FedConnect is offered by subscription fee to Federal Government agencies that are federally regulated. For Reverse Auction only, there is no subscription fee to Federal Government agencies. The bidding and winning vendor company is responsible for payment upon award.\nOn the government side, FedConnect is accessed through a system-to-system interface to the Unison Contracting and Grants software applications, where Government procurement and grant representatives become indirect users of FedConnect.\nOn the Vendor/Applicant side, FedConnect is accessed via the internet with a browser. Anyone can access the FedConnect web site and review public opportunities. However, to receive directed opportunities that are not publicly issued, respond electronically, and receive ongoing communications, a vendor/applicant must be registered.\nTo learn more about FedConnect and its capabilities, please visit the public portion of the FedConnect site.",

        "CSO_Description": "WildFire Government Cloud threat analysis service is an analysis and prevention engine for highly evasive zero-day exploits and malware. The cloud-based service employs a unique multi-technique approach combining dynamic and static analysis and innovative machine learning techniques to detect and prevent even the most evasive threats. It is a subscription service that works with the Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewalls (including VM-Series and CN-Series), Prisma Access, Prisma Cloud, Cortex XSIAM, and Cortex XDR.\n\nCortex XDR is a cloud-based service providing a prevention, detection and response platform that integrates network, endpoint, and cloud data to stop sophisticated attacks. Cortex XDR leverages logs, alerts, and information from Palo Alto Networks and third-party security products. It also enforces security policies on endpoints, preventing malware and data loss. Cortex XDR correlates security alerts and network logs with the endpoint processes that generated the alerts, allowing customers to investigate security alerts, as well as search for and remotely respond to threats.\n\nCortex XSOAR is a comprehensive security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform that unifies case management, automation, real-time collaboration, and threat intelligence management to serve security teams across the incident lifecycle.\n\nCortex XSIAM is a cloud-delivered, integrated SOC platform that unifies key functions, including EDR, XDR, SOAR, ASM, UEBA, TIP, and SIEM, consolidating multiple products into a single, integrated platform. XSIAM delivers an intelligent data foundation by integrating telemetry from any source, providing unified security operations across any hybrid IT architecture.\n\nCortex Xpanse is an active attack surface management solution that helps your organization discover, understand and respond to unknown risks in all internet-connected systems and services. Xpanse scans the entire internet automatically and continuously, discovering and indexing previously unknown risks, using supervised ML models to continuously map your attack surface and prioritize remediation efforts, while reducing MTTR with the help of built-in automated playbooks.\n\nCortex Data Lake collects, normalizes, and integrates data from Palo Alto Networks products with public cloud scale.\n\nPrisma Access is a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) that provides scalable, cloud-delivered networking and security to branch offices and remote users. With Prisma Access, agencies are able to rapidly enable consistent, secure connectivity for remote locations and employees.\n\nPrisma Cloud is a cloud native security platform that provides comprehensive visibility, threat prevention, compliance assurance and data protection consistently across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\n\nPrisma Cloud Compute is a cloud-native platform that delivers cloud workload protection. Prisma Cloud Compute provides holistic protection across hosts, containers, and serverless deployments in any cloud, throughout the software lifecycle. Prisma Cloud Compute protects all workloads regardless of their underlying compute technology or the cloud in which they run. In addition, it provides Web Application and API Security (WAAS) for any cloud native architecture.\n\nCloud Identity Engine - Identity-based security controls are a foundational requirement to achieve Zero Trust. Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine is an entirely new cloud-based architecture for identity-based security that can consistently authenticate and authorize your users, regardless of location and where user identity stores live—on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid. As a result, security teams can effortlessly allow all users access to applications and data everywhere and quickly move toward a Zero Trust security posture.\n\nCloud Manager (Fawkes) is a cloud delivered solution used by customers to manage Prisma Access from Palo Alto Networks’ Hub. Fawkes allows customers to quickly onboard branches and mobile users through an intuitive and function oriented user experience. Fawkes also provides configuration management of   Prisma Access’ security policies.\n\nACE is a generic platform that enables the firewall or Panorama to download App-IDs from the cloud for applications that do not have specific predefined App-IDs from the Palo Alto Networks content releases.\n\nThe main purpose of API Gateway is to support unified access to the open APIs of PANW SASE applications. Currently, API Gateway is used by Cloud Management Prisma Access (Fawkes), SD-WAN, Cortex Data Lake (CDL), and Prisma Access Insights customers.\nWorking in conjunction with PANW Global IdP (Identity Provider), which provides authentication services, API Gateway provides authorization services for RESTful API and routing those APIs to multiple applications and regions.\n\nBridgecrew is a cloud-native platform that secures cloud accounts. It will scan, discover, and report misconfigurations, security risks, and compliance gaps at the source code, Infrastructure as Code and application levels. Bridgecrew could even be configured to auto-remediate issues or anomalies it finds.\n\nPrisma Insights provides a comprehensive platform for global visibility and monitoring for the Prisma Access service. It continuously monitors the health and performance of your Prisma Access environment with Insights in the Prisma Access app.\nPrisma Insights utilizes the following techniques to accomplish its purpose.\n     - Telemetry Data Ingestion from Prisma Access Firewalls\n     - Firewall Log Data Ingestion from Cortex Data Lake\n     - Data Analyzation and Processing Pipelines\n     - Data Presentation to User via Prisma Access UI\n     - Data retrieval via API service\n\nThe MSP solution is a set of two services (pa-passthru-api-service and pa-custom-api-service) that provide APIs to support the following functionality:\nAggregate application, application usage, threats and URL metrics across tenants in a tenant hierarchy Constrain the list of tenants being aggregated to the list of tenants that are authorized for the user in question\n\nPalo Alto Networks’ Enterprise DLP software-as-a-service system is a cloud service that scans data that is flowing through various Palo Alto Networks products, helping provide consistent data protection by allowing organizations to discover, monitor, govern, and secure sensitive data. The solution helps facilitate an organization’s data protection and compliance efforts in a simplified and cost-effective manner.\n\nDLP serves as a data security service integrated with various Palo Alto Networks services (called channels) such as SaaS Security, Prisma Access, Prisma Cloud, and the Next Generation Firewall platform to provide data security at these various enforcement points. These channels send files to the DLP service via APIs, where DLP will scan the file, perform analysis to detect sensitive data in violation of customer policies in the file, and return this verdict and other data back to the channel. The channel then uses this information to take remedial action in order to protect sensitive data.\n\nLumos V&R is the security visualization and reporting product for network security use cases. It provides dashboards to end users to monitor and understand the security of their networks and how different security subscriptions from Palo Alto Networks are performing.\n\nPRISMA SD-WAN controller is a product that provides deep application visibility, with Layer 7 intelligence for network policy creation and traffic engineering. It automates operations and problem avoidance using machine learning and data science methodologies. Prisma SD-WAN enables branch services such as networking and security to be delivered from the cloud, simplifying WAN management.\n\nSaaS Security is an integrated CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) solution that helps Security teams meet the challenges of protecting the growing availability of sanctioned and unsanctioned SaaS applications and maintaining compliance consistently in the cloud while stopping threats to sensitive information, users and resources. SaaS Security options include SaaS Security API, SaaS Security Inline, and SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM).\n\nSaaS Security Inline helps discover and manage risks posed by unsanctioned SaaS applications while SaaS Security API can be used to scan assets in the cloud space for at-rest detection, inspection and remediation across all user, folder and file activity within sanctioned SaaS applications. SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) helps detect and remediate misconfigured security settings in sanctioned SaaS applications through continuous monitoring.",

GetWell Loop provides automated daily check ins via text, email or mobile notifications that keep them engaged with the clinical teams before admission and after discharge; Clinicians receive actionable data that provides a real-time window into the patient’s status - allowing teams to manage by exception; Patients are guided to provide feedback on their clinical teams which drive positive provider reviews and ratings and critically, patients are prompted via the tool, alerts and notifications to maintain adherence to their care plans and that simultaneously educated what to do related to their care, when to do it, and why.\n\n**GetWell Rounds+**\nAccessed via a standard web browser, or via a mobile application, provides a digital rounding, reporting and real-time service recovery solution. Data captured during rounding automatically triggers real-time alerts on service recovery issues, giving nurses the ability to triage tasks to appropriate departments. The tool provides the ability to develop surveys and survey templates infused with patient information and conditional logic. The clinical teams can then use the tool during their rounding workflows to complete those surveys and have that information directed into reports, sent as alerts to other clinical teams, or push data back to the clinical record.\n\n**GetWell Inpatient**\nThe GetWell Inpatient application offers many features which can be accessed through a number of endpoints including Smart TVs, Agency Mobile Devices, and users' personal devices via the GWAF app, all intended to educate, inform, entertain and empower patients while in an inpatient hospital facility. Through integrations with clinical systems, patients and families can order meals, control their room environment, receive personalized education, request medication prescription fills, complete surveys; view history of staff visits and see their plan of care for the day and be entertained with movies, internet access and games. Clinical users can view push information to patients; prescribe education and view critical patient information on room entry screens and other displays, receive patient requests and understand patient system utilization via reports and dashboards.  \n\n**GetWell Anywhere Mobile App**\nFor the patient, the ultimate goal of the Get Well mobile experience is to create a frictionless, guided, cross-continuum patient experience that improves care team efficiency and scalability, facilitates care plan completion, and retains patient business in-network and grows share of wallet. \n\n**The vision of the Get Well mobile experience:** \n\n* Engages patients through pre-admission, hospital stay, and recovery at home\n* Feels like the care team is guiding the patient every step of the way\n* Automatically enable check-ins with patients while they are in the hospital and at-home\n* Surfaces critical patient information for the care team (even if patient is in a different setting of care)\n* Enables ongoing communication, monitoring and relationship development to improve outcomes and share of wallet\n* Performs as a TV remote control when the patient is assigned to a hospital room with a registered patient device.\n\nThe Get Well platform can be integrated closely with many clinical and non-clinical systems used by the agency health systems. Integrations types include HL7 integrations for data exchange with EHRs and other clinical systems over secure tunnels; API integrations over secure web communication for integration against systems which support it such as dietary, real time location services; SAML and other authentication integrations to staff directory services; secure file based integrations via SFTP for batch level data integration or file exchange; and a number of other secure messaging integrations for relaying alerts and information to clinical staff.\n\n All components of the platform are hosted in our Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud environment and are provided as a fully supported and managed service to healthcare customers.",

These include current service offerings (SaaS) such as Oracle Service Cloud, planned services offerings such as Fusion, PBCS, and Taleo, and any other service Oracle may implement in the future (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS). The environment serves as a community cloud that supports current and future Oracle Cloud FedRAMP-compliant systems. The authorization boundary of the system includes the common hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, facilities, and people that provide support for a variety of users and applications and will be leveraged by future Oracle Cloud authorization packages. The OGC-CC boundary starts at the premise router and ends with the physical cable that connects to each Oracle Cloud Service’s firewall. The dependent system boundaries start at each service’s firewall, and each service is responsible for all assets (hardware/software), policies, procedures, and any other item thereafter.",

For both types of customers, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or FedRAMP authorized AWS PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets.  VPC Firewall access controls ensure that each customer's subnet is completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer's subnet.  \n\nFor GSS One- AWS customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the GSS One- AWS FedRAMP package.  Namely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with the GSS One- AWS architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\n\nFor ISV customers, Project Hosts also creates their SaaS-level FedRAMP package, helps them throughout the agency authorization process, and manages their 3PAO annual assessments. \n\nFor agency customers, Project Hosts assists them in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides a monthly application-level POA&M.  \n\nIf an agency would like to use one of these Applications or bring in another GSS One- AWS compatible Application, Project Hosts will provide application-level artifacts that will help the agency assess the risk of deploying that application in the FPC as well as any other documentation or evidence required in order to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO).",

Either way, customer subnets are connected to the PaaS security subnets through V-net peering as described more fully here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview .\n\nFor GSS One- Azure customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the GSS One- Azure FedRAMP package.  Namely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with GSS One- Azure architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\n\nFor ISV customers, Project Hosts also creates their SaaS-level FedRAMP package, helps them throughout the agency authorization process, and manages their 3PAO annual assessments.\n\nFor agency customers, Project Hosts assists them in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides a monthly application-level POA&M.  Following is a partial list of applications for which Project Hosts is providing these services over and above the GSS One- Azure platform:\n\n* Accenture Federal (Task management Tool)\n* Blue Prism (Blue Prism)\n* BrightWork (BrightWork SharePoint-based Project Management)\n* Checkmarx (CxSAST Source Code Scanner)\n* Drupal (Drupal CMS)\n* FlowVU (FlowVU Collaboration)\n* Gimmal (Gimmal Records Management)\n* Lexmark (Managed Print Service)\n* Microsoft (Office, Dynamics, Power BI Server, Project Server, SharePoint, SSRS)\n* Sopheon (Accolade Enterprise Innovation Management)\n* UMT360 (SharePoint-based Enterprise Portfolio Management)\n* Veritas (eVault, eDiscovery, Merge1)\n* WordPress (WordPress CMS)\n* Permuta (Defense Ready)\n* Gimmal (Records Management)\n* Invoke (UiPath Orchestrator and RPA)\n* Conga (Contract Lifecycle Management and Conga Approvals)\n* Davra (WebEx Legislate, Internet of Things)\n* Ephesoft (Transact)\n* OM Group Inc (ProjNet)\n* Nintex (K2 Five, Workflow Cloud)\n* WordPress As a Service (WPaaS)\n* C3 AI (C3 AI Suites)\n* MURAL (MURAL for Government)\n* WillCo Tech (CyberSTAR)\n* Kofax (Control Suite, Kofax TotalAgility, Kofax Robotics Process Automation)\nIf an agency would like to use one of these Applications or bring in another GSS One- Azure-compatible Application, Project Hosts will provide application-level artifacts that will help the agency assess the risk of deploying that application in the GSS One- Azure as well as any other documentation or evidence required in order to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO).",

Use LEM to track and manage the components that take accountability to the next level.\n* Patient Call Manager: Checking on a patient at a critical point in their care is proven to have an impact. Whether it’s showing empathy or providing a clinical intervention, these calls improve patient safety and experiences — and offer an opportunity to receive first-hand feedback from patients. With Patient Call Manager™ (PCM), healthcare organizations can prioritize and connect patients with caregivers to ease transitions from in-person care to home. This fully HIPAA-compliant tool allows healthcare staff to serve as quality touchpoints and ensure quality outcomes along a patient’s continuum of care from pre-visit calls through post-visit.\n* Huron Rounding: A cloud-based, multiplatform technology, the Huron Rounding application helps organizations easily collect quality, safety, satisfaction, and other audit and compliance data for analysis and reporting.",

You can schedule regular Phishing Security Tests from our large library of over 2,500 \"known-to-work\" templates or you can also create your own custom phishing templates. And with our powerful Smart Groups feature, you can use each employees’ behavior and user attributes to tailor phishing campaigns, training assignments, remedial learning and reporting.\nYour enterprise can get the KnowBe4 platform quickly deployed into production. Our Customer Success team gets you going in no time, without the need for consulting hours. And our Active Directory Integration (ADI) allows you to easily sync user data and saves you time by eliminating the need to manually manage user changes. Once the ADI is configured, users will be added, changed and archived in sync with changes made within AD automatically.\n**We use FedRAMP compliant Amazon Web Services East (AWS US East), which is maintained in an ISO certified facility.** There is no unauthorized external access to data, we only store just enough information to accomplish the services we are set to provide, which minimally are email addresses with recorded clicks. All email addresses are encrypted and kept private. And KnowBe4 has been PCI compliant from day one. KnowBe4 courses are SCORM compliant, so we can deliver courseware for your in-house LMS if needed. However, KnowBe4 does have its own LMS that lives in the cloud, and we can report back to you about all enrolled employees, their status, completion, and many other parameters.",

        "CSO_Description": "LaunchDarkly’s enterprise feature management platform allows agencies to standardize the fast release of software across on-premises and cloud environments, improving the control, availability, and security of government applications and sites. Through feature flags, LaunchDarkly Federal enables agencies to decouple feature releases from code deployments at enterprise scale. Agencies can easily track and manage flags across multiple applications and platforms, with a deep and granular level of targeting, control, and visibility. Government agencies can deploy faster, reduce risk, and iterate continuously. Feature management enables new feature rollouts, quick resolution of incidents, and increased productivity of development teams. It also reduces the need for a large number of pre-production environments. Agencies improve their DevSecOps processes, respond to CVEs and breaches faster, facilitate Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and ship more code with far less risk. \n\nLaunchDarkly Federal enables:\n\n* Resolution of incidents in less than 200 milliseconds, without costly rollbacks that threaten other features.\n* Powerful targeting capabilities that provide complete control over which users or microservices can see new features.\n* Safe testing in production—empowering teams with real-world QA testing that reduces the need for costly pre-production environments.\n* Low-risk CI/CD development processes that improve developer productivity and new feature release times.\n* Hypothesis-driven development, including A/B/n experimentation and percentage rollouts.\n* More adaptive and controlled responses to cybersecurity incidents.\n\nLaunchDarkly Federal provides developers and business stakeholders with a central location to manage the rollout of new features. At the same time, it can enforce change management policies through scheduling, approval workflows, and custom role-based access control down to the feature level. Agencies can implement their own policies around the use of personally identifiable information (PII) and take advantage of targeting without needing to store user PII within the LaunchDarkly Federal SaaS environment. Additional hosting options and an offline mode are available for organizations with more restrictive policies.\n\nOrganizations use LaunchDarkly Federal, a FedRAMP-authorized feature management platform, as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application either via a [web portal](https://app.launchdarkly.us) or LaunchDarkly’s APIs. As part of its FedRAMP-authorized cloud service offering, LaunchDarkly provides SDKs (Software Developers Kits) which allow your applications to interact with LaunchDarkly Federal across the following programming languages and frameworks listed [here](https://launchdarkly.com/features/sdk/).

        "CSO_Description": "Since 2004, more than 30 federal agencies have trusted moveLINQ to process thousands of employee moves annually. As the first comprehensive, fully functional system designed expressly for government agencies to manage employee relocation, that trust is well founded. Agencies can be confident that every relocation processed using moveLINQ will be in full compliance. The software automates FTR, JTR, DSSR, and 6FAM CONUS/OCONUS relocation policy, and adheres to E-Gov Travel, GSA/OMB reporting, and Section 508 standards.\nNow mLINQS offers its leading relocation management on a hosted platform. As with other hosted solutions, this Software as a Service (SaaS) model provides agencies higher availability at a lower cost. Federal managers are able to focus their budgets on business objectives rather than infrastructure and the need to predict and meet future capacity. By leveraging efficiencies attained by hosting multiple federal agencies, mLINQS Hosting Services provides increased scalability and flexibility while increasing support services to customers.",

Government Agencies interested in this technology\ncan utilize their relationship with Modus to pursue these powerful tools in your\neDiscovery objectives.\n\n**Discovery Production** As electronically stored information has become more\ndiverse and voluminous, the specificity and complexity of production formats\nhave similarly increased. Today, productions may be required in various formats,\nincluding native, PDF, and TIFF, with or without intricate load files, extracted text,\nand other features. Conforming, precisely and consistently, to mandated\nproduction specifications is an essential component of eDiscovery's success.\nModus’ production services include:\n\n* Native Production\n* PDF Production\n* TIFF Production\n* Hybrid Production\n* Custom Load File Creation\n* Slipsheet/Placeholder Generation\n* Endorsements and Bates Numbering\n\n**Data Collection and Forensics** The collection of potentially relevant materials –\nwhether physically or electronically stored – is a critical early step in the\neDiscovery process. Successful execution of a collection requires the\nmaintenance of forensic soundness and the chain of custody from source to\nproduction, as well as the tools and experience to collect from today’s\never-multiplying range of sources. Modus’ collection services include:\n\n* Evidence Identification.\n* Data Harvesting & Forensic Collection\n* Forensic Imaging\n* Live & Targeted Data Acquisitions\n* Preservation\n\n**Analysis eDiscovery Processing** To facilitate hosted review and production, all\ncollected electronically stored information must be processed.

Modus processing services enable you\nto use our hosted review platform or your own. We’ve built processing templates\nfor all the leading ECA and review tools to ensure you get pristine loads and fast,\naccurate, and consistent processing no matter which downstream tools you use.\nWe can quickly customize or build a new template to meet your requirements.\nProcessing Types Including:\n\n* Native File\n* Full TIFF\n* Email\n\n**Other Processing Services:**\n\n* Analytical Reporting\n* File Type Analysis\n* De-NISTing\n* Date Filtering\n* File Type/Categorized Filtering/ StellentID\n* Standard and Search-Based Processing\n* Metadata Extraction\n* De-Duplication (Custodial or Global)\n* Near-Duplicate Identification and Handling\n* Email Threading\n* Foreign Language Identification (with Percentages and Rankings)",

Its web interface offers fully secure email archiving with robust search and discovery, supervision, and enforcement features. The solution securely stores electronic messages for a specified retention period, while keeping the messages fully searchable and retrievable in real-time or with a batch process. This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user’s email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with *Proofpoint’s DoubleBlind™ Encryption* technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.\n*Proofpoint’s DoubleBlind™ Encryption* technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE’s web-based user interface. Data can never be viewed without access to both the archiving CPE within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment and the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment.",

        "CSO_Description": "The Qualtrics XM Platform is a web-based application that allows Government agencies to create surveys and then collect, analyze, and store the data produced from those surveys. Government agencies can use the application to collect and analyze citizen, employee, and community feedback to improve services and engagement for both external customers (citizens) and internal customers (public sector employees). The Qualtrics XM Platform enables multiple departments within an agency to collect and analyze survey data within a single enterprise system, allowing all levels of the agency or department to have access to important feedback data. The XM Platform includes an array of services that can be utilized to track, manage, and improve the experience of external and internal customers, such as:\n• XM Core – Allows agencies to construct surveys, distribute them to participants, and then manage and analyze individual participant responses. Agencies can then create reports that present the results and publish these reports to the web or share the report links with others.\n• Customer Experience - Allows agencies to study and improve the customer experience by employing Relationship NPS, Transactional NPS, Customer Satisfaction, and Event Feedback programs.\n• Employee Experience - Allows agencies to measure and manage employee engagement by creating feedback loops for relevant aspects of public sector employment, such as Manager Feedback, Training Feedback, Employee Engagement, and Employee Pulse programs.\n• Site Intercept – Allows agencies to display a piece of text, graphic, or widget that encourages a visitor to their website to take a survey or redirect to a specific webpage. To implement, the agency administrator places a snippet of Qualtrics’ JavaScript code on the agency’s website.\n• Actions and Tickets - Allows defining and triggering a workflow when a set of conditions are met, such as creating support tickets or integrating with external systems via web service API.\n• Data Analytics - Provides ability to perform natural language processing, statistical and predictive analysis of the data collected via the Research Suite.\n• Reports and Dashboards – Enables agencies to build dashboards that provide visual displays of the data collected from an agency’s surveys combined with other imported data sources.\nQualtrics creates a library where each agency can store question templates, graphics, messages, and files to be used in building surveys and sending messages to participants. Agencies can integrate data from other sources, such as their customer relationship management (CRM) tools, and produce and share reports. They can upload a list of contacts as a CSV file or manually enter or edit contacts. Agencies can also view the complete history of interactions that they have had with their contacts via emails or survey responses.\nThe XM Platform allows customers to send surveys, notifications, and other messages via a built-in email mechanism. To enable this, the application provides an outbound mail delivery engine via SMTP. In addition, customers can generate a URL that links to their survey and send the URL out to survey participants via their own email systems.\nReports and data can be exported to a variety of formats, including Word, Excel, PDF, and CSV/TSV, etc.\nThe XM Platform provides an Administration tool that allows designated agency admins to create groups and user permissions and assign them to authorized agency users. Permissions can be set up at the agency, division, or organization level. A single sign-on (SSO) capability enables agencies to implement identity federation via LDAP, SAML / Shibboleth, central authentication service (CAS), or OAuth 2.0. Qualtrics also makes available a REST API to allow agencies to automate functions such as connecting Qualtrics surveys with external systems such as a CRM like Salesforce.",

BeyondTrust’s SRA system allows organizations to apply the principle of least privilege through granular access management and extensive audit capabilities to their employees, vendors, and service desk personnel. PRA provides organizations the ability to control, manage, and audit the privileged access to sensitive systems and data without the use of a traditional virtual private network (VPN). PRA also allows for an enhanced approach to privilege session management to platforms in all environments, as well as secure password management and web access. RS provides service desk personnel secure access to fix remote devices, running on different platforms, through one solution. Common use cases include supporting multiple operating systems (OSs), like MAC, Linux, Mobile iOS, and Android devices. Additionally, RS allows organizations to extend the help desk perimeter while increasing security. ",

Building on two decades of innovation and security, T-Metrics’ CCaaS solution is the only single omnichannel contact center in the market that meets both the robust FedRAMP security standards for cloud deployments and the security and interoperability demands of the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certification for premises-based deployments.\n\nThrough its flexible architecture, the TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center enables agencies to customize cloud deployment models – public cloud (multi-tenant) and/or private cloud (dedicated instance) – to address different constituent requirements.\n\nStrategically designed, TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center capitalizes on cloud architecture to integrate an agency's existing staff with existing customer telephony platforms (e.g., Avaya, Cisco, MS Teams, Zoom, etc.), which minimizes migration and project risk.

This flexibility allows for zero-maintenance for full cloud deployments. Agencies choosing on-premises integration will provision hardware according to their own requirements and procedures. \n\nThe TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center can be scaled to accommodate current and future contact center resource demands and requirements. The ability to obtain agent subscriptions in small or large quantities enables organizations to quickly scale to levels necessary to handle even the most dynamic volume, especially for emergencies or seasonal demand.

Resiliency, scalability, and advanced feature access were traditionally available to only the largest contact centers with significant capital investment. Through the TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center, these advantages are now available to every customer through flexible monthly subscriptions. \n\nThe cloud-based service offerings provided by the T-Metrics TM-Cloud Omnichannel Contact Center include the following:\n*  Skills-based and Attribute-based Routing (ACD)\n*  Interactive Voice Response\n*  Microsoft TeamsTM Integration\n*  Digital Channel Communication\n*  Customer & Agent Callbacks\n*  Voice and Screen Recordings\n*  Analytics and Sentiment Analysis\n*  Quality Management\n*  Section 508 compliance (for agents and callers)\n*  Advanced Agent and Supervisory Dashboards\n*  Standard and Custom Reporting\n*  Self Service Administration Portals\n*  Natural language speech recognition\n*  Voicebots and chatbots\n\nTo learn more about how the T-Metrics CCaaS solution can satisfy your contact center requirements, please visit https://www.tmetrics.com/industries/fedramp.\n",

ESC GovCloud consolidates advanced threat prevention with traditional Email Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus security to optimize spending, reduce false positives, and enable operational efficiencies through consolidation. ESC GovCloud can be deployed in line to analyze emails and quarantine threats for active protection, or as a passive monitor for ‘bcc’ type review of each email.\n\nWith no hardware or software to install, the ESC GovCloud is a particularly good fit for organizations seeking to move their infrastructure into the cloud. This eliminates the complexity of procuring, installing, and managing a physical infrastructure. ESC GovCloud provides organizations several unique capabilities, such as:\n\n* Identifying previous targets of spear-phishing, impersonation, virus and spam emails\n* Locating copies of the malicious email in target inboxes\n* Finding out if the message is being forwarded to new targets\n* Detection of advanced malicious URL threats\n* The ESC Portal shows region- and industry-based malware trends, has customizable security policies, RBAC, and audit logging.\n\n Organizations face an ever-increasing number of threats from email-based spam, viruses, and advanced threats. ESC GovCloud uses the signature-less Trellix Multi-vector Virtual Execution™ (MVX) engine to analyze every attachment and URL within emails to detect threats and stop advanced attacks in real-time. Today’s advanced attacks use email as a primary delivery mechanism for malicious content. While some attacks use an attachment with embedded malicious code, it is common for cybercriminals to use a malicious link thereby blending attack tactics in the hopes of bypassing today’s traditional defense silos. ESC GovCloud uses the cloud-based MVX engine to detonate email attachments against a cross-matrix of operating systems and applications, including multiple Web browsers and plug-ins like Adobe Reader and Flash. To block spear-phishing emails, ESC GovCloud analyzes every attachment using the MVX engine to accurately identify today’s advanced attacks.\n\nESC GovCloud includes anti-virus and anti-spam engines and may also be paired with an organization’s existing anti-virus and anti-spam email gateways.",

        "CSO_Description": "The US AI platform is a managed service comprised of a suite of microapps and microservices built on an AI-powered data lake, zero-trust framework, and hyperscale microservices infrastructure. Using microservices, US AI decomposes complex business components into smaller, autonomous services that are infinitely more scalable. US AI operates under a multi-tenancy model, where customers have the option to leverage the shared tenant to save money or have their own tenant to house their unique data; all while also leveraging the hyperscale community database containing hundreds of millions of valuable, common, and curated records for acquisition, grants, finance, health, and supply chain. A cloud native infrastructure, US AI scales elastically and dynamically, and relies on infrastructure automation and devsecops to optimize the operations and management of the infrastructure. The US AI suite consists of microapps, mobile apps, and microservices that power global business operations through a suite of services:\r1. **Archangel** - Archangel demystifies, automates, and streamlines the cybersecurity lifecycle, from Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) to Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM). Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and security professionals apply AI to eliminate redundancy, digitize workflows, and automate security accreditation by predicting compliance with security controls. Additionally, CSPs and security professionals apply Blockchain, AI, and RPA to continuously monitor device logs and predict vulnerabilities and breaches. Lastly, security, supply chain, and risk management professionals apply AI to predict global security and supply chain risks.\r2. **Forsight** - Forsight is a novel general purpose AI platform that uses unsupervised and supervised machine learning to collect, sanitize, curate, and index both structured and unstructured acquisition, emergency response, finance, grants, health, and supply chain data within a high performing, parallel processing data lake. Forsight facilitates the extraction of crucial business insights and predictions for price optimization, compliance, risk, fraud, etc. Lastly, Forsight connects humans to the AI workflow to train the machine to make better predictions.\r3. **Gini** - Gini applies Blockchain, AI, and RPA to intelligently automate the grants life cycle, institutionalize a standardized pre-award risk framework, and reconcile financial ledgers throughout the grant ecosystem. Grants professionals and recipients use the digital dossier to share data and reduce recipient burden and administrative costs. Gini runs on hyperscale community database that consolidates, curates, and indexes over 100TB of data from 30+ public and private data sources. Gini uses AI to scan millions of records of data including single audits to extract key findings, including but not limited to financial health; procurement, suspension, and debarment; improper cash management; excessive executive pay, eligibility; etc.\r4. **Illuminate** - Illuminate is a collection of emerging technologies that power a state-of-the-art supply chain ecosystem. Contracting professionals leverage intelligent automation to accelerate acquisition, make smarter buys, and ensure compliance. Additionally, contracting professionals leverage AI to automate contract formation, administration, and closeout. Lastly, supply chain leaders use Blockchain and AI to track the provenance of goods and services and “illuminate” areas of inefficiencies.\r5. **Siqi** - Siqi is a collection of emerging technologies that power a state-of-the-art healthcare ecosystem. Siqi uses mobile and micro apps to collect vital personal health information and save transactional information onto a blockchain. Personal digital identity and health records are protected via encryption and self-sovereign identity. Siqi uses AI to predict the presence of disease such as COVID, skin cancer, etc. and provides an immutable digital provenance for contact tracing and disease analysis.\r6. **Velicus** – Velicus applies Blockchain and AI to combat global pandemics by transforming the global emergency response through a coordinated ecosystem. Velicus facilitates the global emergency response process to pandemics like COVID-19, Ebola, SARS, MERS, etc. Participants in the emergency response value chain can track the geolocation, health, and safety of responders, connecting to their deployment force anywhere in the world. AI is used to match responders to an event based on requirements such as skill, education, mental health, etc.",

Webex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government consists of an integrated, cloud-based feature set of core and optional components that provide for Auto Call Distribution (ACD), Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Computer Telephony Integration (CTI), outbound services, reporting, mobile applications, and IP telephony—all on an omnichannel basis. Solution features include:\n**Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)**\n* Routing services based on Cisco’s Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) technology.\n* **ACD functionality** which allows collection and routing of calls to a contact center agent; conversion of calls to formats that can be carried by a data network to their recipient; rules-based routing; multi-skilled expert agent selection; precision routing; supervisor features; call prompting; announcements; and music-on-hold and queuing capabilities.\n* **Precision routing**, which sends the contact to the best available resource based on information about the caller and the attributes of the agent. By delivering the contact effectively, companies can reduce overall handling time, decrease the need for multiple transfers, and increase customer satisfaction with the experience. Precision routing is supported for all contact channels, including voice, video, web, chat, and email.\n* **Computer Telephony Integration (CTI):** Screen pops based on ANI or customer-entered information can be used to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n* **Queue enhancements:** includes priority within queue, announcements/prompts within the queue, redirect on no answer.\n**Agent and supervisor desktop**\nIncluded with Webex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government is the Cisco Finesse ® desktop, a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop designed to provide easy access to the applications and information your customer service organization needs through a customizable web-based interface.

These features add value to the supervisor’s role in the contact center and help them effectively manage their teams. These capabilities include:\n* **chat capabilities for supervisors and agents.** Supervisors can send chat messages to agents participating in a call, allowing supervisors to coach agents unobtrusively on cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and help agents resolve customer situations. Supervisors can interrupt an agent’s call to create a three-way conference, and then interact with both the caller and the agent to help resolve a concern. A supervisor can remove the agent from a call using the Intercept feature, allowing the supervisor and caller to complete the call on their own while the agent handles another customer request.\n* **Change an agent’s state from Supervisor desktop.** Agents may forget to make themselves available to take calls after a break or neglect to log out when away from their workstations for an extended period. Supervisors can easily log out missing agents or make unintentionally idle agents ready to take calls.\n* **Change an agent’s skill profile in real time.** This capability gives supervisors tactical tools to manage their agent teams and support contact center management objectives.\n**Administration and management portal**\nStreamlined administration allows managers to perform all contact center administration centrally. The administrative interface allows agents to be set up to handle voice, web, chat, and email contacts, depending on their assigned skill sets.\nThe interface allows system managers, administrators, and supervisors to develop, modify, or view routing scripts; manage the system configuration; monitor contact center performance; define and request reports; and help ensure system security. This one user interface provides enterprise-wide control across a single or multisite contact center.\nWebex® Contact Center Enterprise for Government web-based administration portal includes capabilities to:\n* Manage access and role-based permissions\n* Search for an agent team or skill group\n* Quickly add or remove agents to or from a skill or team\n* Create agents, change agent passwords, and disable agents\n* Bulk and clone agents\n* Create contact center users\n* Audit trail retention for six months\n* Administer Unified Communications (UC) phones and features\n* Customizable dashboards\n* Enable access to most functions via a mobile device (i.e., a smartphone or tablet if the device is connected to the customer’s network)\n* Create and publish audio files in real time\n* Automate distribution of audio files to media servers\n* Enable/disable pre-recorded audio prompts\n* Access restrictions\n**Self-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR)**\nProvided with the solution is a self-service interactive voice response via Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (Unified CVP). With Unified CVP, you can pay a bill, order products and track delivery, locate a dealer, schedule a pickup, change name and address information, make travel arrangements, check payment status, receive notification of unusual activity, and request literature or product information. Customers can use voice commands to retrieve the information they require without ever speaking with an agent, or to quickly navigate to the correct department or agent who can help them. Unified CVP is designed to simplify business integration, increase flexibility, and provide efficiency gains. These features can reduce business costs and dramatically improve customer satisfaction.",

WC2-H offers the following services to fulfill business or mission requirements:\n* Public Web Hosting ensures the secure and high-availability of public-facing content to meet external communications needs\n* Authenticated/Restricted Web Hosting provides secure and restricted access enclaves with traffic routing through the Treasury TIC\n* Development and Testing Enclaves support the rapid development and testing of applications at the FedRAMP High Impact level.\nThe WC2-H PaaS has undergone rigorous 3PAO assessment and currently has no Critical or High findings. The results of this assessment were presented to the platform’s Authorizing Official in September 2018 and the package was subsequently approved for agency accreditation. WC2-H is fully authorized to onboard Treasury customers.\nThe WC2-H package includes the use of three (3) native AWS tools (Lambda, Config, and CloudWatch) that are pending JAB approval in the FedRAMP marketplace. Given that these tools are in process for CSP accreditation and that AWS is working with the JAB to expedite their approval, the WC2-H Authorizing Official issued an agency risk acceptance to allow use of the WC2-H platform while final accreditation is pending for these tools. Further information regarding this risk acceptance can be provided upon request by contacting the Compliance POC listed below.",

Currently, more than 100 of the Fortune 500 and 20+ federal agencies use Yello to modernize the recruiting process — ultimately helping them find and hire candidates faster. Organizations find job candidates by participating in designated recruiting and hiring events (i.e. in-person career fairs, virtual career fairs, job fairs, classroom presentations, info sessions, diversity conferences, webinars, live-stream events, etc.) Organizations invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to plan and attend — in addition to hours of staff time after the event needed to follow up with candidates. YGRS manages this process from end-to-end in one platform, ultimately leading to faster and more efficient hiring decisions and processes. The solution also helps agencies understand the overall return on investment. The solution includes tools to find candidates, manage recruiting events and keep in touch with candidates, all leading to successful hiring.",

        "CSO_Description": "Zscaler Internet Access delivers your security stack as a service from the cloud, eliminating the cost and complexity of traditional secure web gateway approaches. By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.\n**The Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security**\nThe data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations.\nHowever, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today’s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances — and their associated costs — are out of control. Furthermore, it’s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.\n**Zscaler Internet Access**\nZscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp — all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect — a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office — they get identical protection.\nZscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL. You get full protection from web and Internet threats. And with a cloud platform that supports Cloud Sandboxing, Next-Generation Firewall, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Cloud Application Visibility and Control, you can start with the services you need today and activate others as your needs grow.\nAll these capabilities are delivered from the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, the world’s largest security cloud, which processes more than 30 billion requests a day. With over 100 patents, the Zscaler platform has been architected from the ground up as a truly distributed, multi-tenant cloud with enterprise performance and scale.",

        "CSO_Description": "Zscaler Internet Access delivers your security stack as a service from the cloud, eliminating the cost and complexity of traditional secure web gateway approaches. By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.\n\n**The Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security**\n\nThe data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations.\nHowever, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today’s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances — and their associated costs — are out of control. Furthermore, it’s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.\n\n**Zscaler Internet Access**\n\nZscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp — all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect — a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office — they get identical protection.\n\nZscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL. You get full protection from web and Internet threats. And with a cloud platform that supports Cloud Sandboxing, Next-Generation Firewall, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Cloud Application Visibility and Control, you can start with the services you need today and activate others as your needs grow.\n\nAll these capabilities are delivered from the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, the world’s largest security cloud, which processes more than 30 billion requests a day. With over 100 patents, the Zscaler platform has been architected from the ground up as a truly distributed, multi-tenant cloud with enterprise performance and scale.",

With Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant.

        "Description": "Based in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, Emagine IT (EIT) provides tailored cybersecurity and enterprise IT services to improve risk postures and deliver digital transformation to its commercial and federal customer. EIT specializes in delivering cost conscious, innovative solutions to meet the evolving business requirements of the clients we serve. As a Type C FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), EIT is authorized to conduct independent security risk assessments for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and deliver FedRAMP consulting services. EIT’s 3PAO services provide multiple levels of security assessment for CSP’s looking to comply with FedRAMP and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. While many CSP’s set out to and achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO), others simply want to be held to the highest standard. With over 1,000 federal assessments based on NIST controls, EIT is ready to support your needs. We offer Gap Assessments, FedRAMP Assessments, Readiness Assessments, Turn-key SSP Documentation and Consulting, Penetration Testing, and Threat Hunting.\n\n**FedRAMP Readiness Assessment / Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)**\n\nSome organizations may opt to pursue a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to help market their platform and attract an agency sponsor. This step toward your eventual FedRAMP authorization does not require a full penetration test, but you must still demonstrate a level of maturity aligned with the FedRAMP security framework. EIT can quickly support this FedRAMP stage with a four-week assessment timeline that may lead to your “FedRAMP Ready” designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.\n\n**FedRAMP Assessment & Attestation**\n\nAs a FedRAMP 3PAO, EIT has performed thousands of security assessments across the federal and commercial landscape. Because EIT has been on both sides of the process, we believe advisors make the best assessors. Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists. They understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. Working with EIT means you are mitigating risk and maintaining the agreed-upon timelines. Through the FedRAMP assessment process, EIT will develop the required documentation, including a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) to document assessment results, Security Assessment Report (SAR), and recommendation for authorization.\n\n**FedRAMP Advisory & Remediation**\n\nAre you transitioning to a new FIPS-199 designation, requiring you to comply with more controls? Are you thinking about implementing a multi-cloud deployment strategy? Are you trying to find ways to leverage your current compliance and security investments to help you achieve your FedRAMP authorization? Working collaboratively with your teams, we will identify, understand, and help you overcome your unique FedRAMP compliance challenges as we walk you through your FedRAMP preparation. With the gap assessment in-hand, EIT will work with your team to map out and engineer the ideal system architecture and to document the necessary environment and security practices within your custom-tailored System Security Plan (SSP). Our advisory services can encompass various CSP systems and service models to ensure that timelines are defined and met, deficiencies in system architecture and policies are mended, understanding of FedRAMP controls and procedures is achieved, annual audits and ATO renewal process is smooth with dedicated continuous monitoring.\n\n**Gap Assessment**\n\nThe first step in the certification process is to determine your organization’s readiness. How confident are you that you can move forward with your FedRAMP goals? Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your organization’s operations and security architecture. These discovery activities are led by EIT’s subject matter experts through hands-on workshops and interviews with key personnel in your organization, culminating in a final report that describes critical gaps and prescribes recommendations for remediation.\n\n**FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMonaaS)**\n\nMaintaining documentation and systems that are outmoded but still essential can command more resources than most organizations can sustain. FedRAMP is a continuous program, rather than just a project with a start and end date. The EIT team will establish and assist with the monthly, quarterly, and annual continuous monitoring activities and reports required to maintain your authority to operate. This offering can be integrated with your organization’s many compliance requirements, such as CMMC, FISMA, HITRUST, ISO, and more.",

These documents may also be leveraged in support of the organization’s Authorization to Operate (ATO). \n\n**Full Assessment**: Review all system documentation to ensure all NIST SP 800-53 and organizational security controls are in place. The assessors will interview necessary organizational staff to confirm policy implementation and gather applicable evidence. This will also include vulnerability and penetration testing of the environment. At the conclusion of this phase, the package will be submitted to either the sponsoring federal agency or the Joint Authorization Board (JAB).\n\n**Continuous Monitoring**: Mitigate the assessment findings by working with system owners to update any policy or procedures that are non-compliant. MBL will also work with network administrators to recommend remediation processes for technical vulnerabilities. \n\n**Annual Assessment/Monthly Scanning**: Perform monthly scanning of the environment in support of the FedRAMP continuous monitoring requirements. This phase will also include an annual assessment of one-third of the information system’s security controls. \n\n**FedRAMP Readiness**: Conduct the readiness assessment, which would result in identified gaps for mitigation as an organization moves into the assessment preparation/pre-assessment phase.\n\nPerformed Assessments for SAP NS2 (2018) & Avue Technologies (2016 & 2017)",
